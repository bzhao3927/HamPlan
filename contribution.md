## Benjamin Zhao
Designed and implemented the RAG pipeline architecture using OpenAI embeddings and GPT-4-turbo. Conducted iterative prompt engineering to fix conversation memory bugs and implement scope control. Coordinated faculty evaluation, analyzed feedback, and wrote the report.

## Ognian Trajanov
Built web scraper for Hamilton's 2025-2026 course catalog, extracting 824 courses and 41 department requirements. Created the `courses_with_prerequisites.json` data structure and processed catalog data for the embedding pipeline. Developed and deployed the frontend interface at hamiltoncourse.com.

## Ken Lam
Conducted initial prompt engineering experiments and tested baseline system prompts. Explored different conversation memory thresholds and scope control implementations. Assisted with system testing, validation, and provided feedback on prompt effectiveness.

## Cade Boiney
Contacted all 28 departments via email to collect course syllabi. Coordinated with department chairs and managed follow-up communications. Successfully collected 86 syllabi across 15 departments through persistent faculty outreach.
