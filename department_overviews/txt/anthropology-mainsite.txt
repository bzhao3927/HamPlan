About the Major
At Hamilton, anthropology is a holistic discipline. Students and faculty consider and deconstruct inference from language, behavior, material culture, and biological adaptations of humans. They trace how our questions, pursuits, and dilemmas have emerged in ways shaped by power and inequality. Through their coursework and research opportunities, Hamilton students develop the theoretical and methodological toolkits to better understand human diversity.
Students Will Learn To:
Identify disciplinary fundamentals from multiple sub-disciplinary perspectives
Interpret anthropological themes from a critical perspective
Combine practice and methodology through research design
Apply disciplinary theoretical perspective(s) in an original research project
Create anthropological knowledge for and with multiple communities
A Sampling of Courses
Anthropology of Food
This course examines how culturally variant practices of food and eating are actively involved in (1) creating and maintaining sociality, (2) constructing and reinforcing identity, and (3) in shaping global relations of power and inequalities. Through reading ethnographies, watching films, and discussing materials in class, this course will introduce you to other ways of viewing, experiencing, and understanding food. It will also provide an opportunity to inquire how our role as consumers reinforces certain global food-ways, impacting many people who remain unseen in the process.

Resilience and Collapse: Archaeological Perspectives on People and the Environment
Archaeology offers the opportunity to examine social-ecological systems over long time scales. This course explores different ways of conceptualizing these systems and considers major topics such as: decreasing biodiversity, traditional ecological knowledge, human-environment interactions related to food production, social responses to natural disasters and climate change, and resilience and collapse of past societies. We’ll engage with discussions on sustainability and our ecological impact on the environment.
Archaeology of Migration
Human beings are a species in motion, and migration has defined our interactions with each other and the natural world. This course explores the social, organizational, and environmental consequences of migration in the past. Highlights the roles that migration has played in transformative changes in social, economic, and political organization in the human past. Examines the material consequences of migration using artifactual and human molecular evidence. Also explores the interplay between humans and the environment as people moved into previously unoccupied landscapes.
Anthropology of Social Media
This course introduces students to the anthropology of social media, drawing on empirical and ethnographic accounts to explore how social media use is embedded in and reflective of specific cultural contexts. We will also consider how social media research can be combined with more traditional ethnographic methods in order to understand how people live their lives both online and offline. Students will work together in small groups throughout the semester to design and produce a podcast that presents an ethnographic analysis of a social media topic of their choice.
Brown v. What: Race and Education in the U.S.
When it comes to American schools and universities, race is everywhere. Schools are sites where many students learn what race is. This seminar examines how education is used to make the racial "other," and how educators and activists use education politically for equality and social justice. The course will also examine how contemporary educational practices continue to make and remake racial categories in the context of formal and non-formal education.
Sociolinguistics of Globalization
Explores the relationship between language variation and change, on the one hand, and the movement of sound and image in the wake of social and political economic processes variously identified as globalization, on the other hand. Of special concern are the ways in which processes of globalization are mediated by institutional and national forms.
