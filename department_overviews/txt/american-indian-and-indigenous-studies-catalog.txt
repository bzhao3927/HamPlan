Department/Program Goals
The American Indian and Indigenous Studies program is both interdisciplinary and extradisciplinary, spanning academic departments, disciplines, and fields of inquiry to integrate Indigenous ways of knowing and knowledge across the curriculum. The program will provide learning opportunities through an innovative, community-based, and reciprocal partnership with the Oneida Indian Nation. Learning opportunities within AIIS will contribute to honoring the 1793 Promise – the foundation and establishment of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy through a gift from the Oneida Indian Nation.
Department/Program Student Learning Outcomes
Students will learn to:
Recognize the significance of different forms of knowledge produced by Indigenous leaders, writers, artists, or activists within its cultural and historical context.
Describe historical events and cultural contexts that shaped Indigenous communities prior to colonial contact
Analyze specific examples of Indigenous peoples’ encounters with different forms of colonialism and assess their immediate impacts.
Interpret the long-term consequences of colonialism for Indigenous communities across historical and contemporary periods.
Explain how contemporary Indigenous communities assert agency, practice sovereignty, and envision future futures in response to ongoing colonial structures.
