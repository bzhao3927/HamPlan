Department/Program Goals
The goal of the Religious Studies Department is to nurture students' curiosity about societies around the globe from ancient to contemporary times and how they have made meaning, transcended boundaries, and found ways to live well; think critically about diversity within and among religious traditions; examine the intersections of religion and society, politics, and culture; and do all this while employing a range of approaches, methods, and theories.
Department/Program Student Learning Outcomes
Students will learn to:
Demonstrate understanding of multiple religious traditions
Articulate a critical understanding of the category of religion and related terms
Communicate clearly, coherently, and effectively about religion and religious traditions
