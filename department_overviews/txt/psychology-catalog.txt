Department/Program Goals
The goal of the Psychology Department is to provide students with the tools to pursue novel questions about behavior and the mind using the scientific method. Strong emphasis is placed on helping students learn to communicate their ideas clearly and concisely.
Department/Program Student Learning Outcomes
Students will learn to:
Explain how behavior and the mind are shaped by a variety of factors (e.g., biological, sociocultural)
Evaluate sources, evidence, and psychological theories critically
Employ appropriate research methods and statistics to address novel psychological questions ethically
Communicate ideas clearly and concisely, demonstrating awareness of both disciplinary conventions and the target audience
Concentration/Minor Description and Requirements
A concentration in Psychology consists of ten courses: a 100-level introductory course;
PSYCH-201
; either
PSYCH-204
or
PSYCH-205
; one laboratory course numbered between 300 and 327 (except
PSYCH-320
);
PSYCH-380
; and five additional courses at the 300 level or above, including the Senior Project.
Students may place out of the introductory-level course by earning a 5 on the Psychology AP exam; a 6 or 7 on the Standard Level Psychology IB test (with IB Diploma); or a 5, 6, or 7 on the Higher Level Psychology IB test (with IB Diploma), and will receive 1 Hamilton College credit upon receiving a minimum grade of B in Psych/Neuro 201. The credit may not be applied toward the Psychology concentration or minor; concentrators must still take a total of ten courses.
To fulfill the Social, Structural, and Institutional Hierarchies requirement in Psychology, concentrators must take either ONE course from the following list:
PSYCH-321
(Psychology of Gender and Leadership)
PSYCH-324
(Law and Human Behavior)
PSYCH-379
(Lifespan Development) Formerly PSYCH-350
PSYCH-359
(Stereotyping and Prejudice)

PSYCH-355

Courses taken off-campus may fulfill the SSIH requirement; students should consult with the chair to determine whether the course(s) will count toward the first or second list, above.
Students should plan to complete their lab requirement and
PSYCH-380
before completing their Senior Project. The Senior Project involves an extensive research and theoretical inquiry culminating in a written thesis and an oral presentation. Starting with the class of 2025, the Senior Project will be completed in one semester with the option to complete the project in either the fall or spring semester.
Students may not take any course at the 200 level or above on a credit/no credit basis if the course will be used to fulfill concentration or minor requirements.
Departmental honors in psychology recognize the distinguished achievement of students who excel in their coursework in the concentration.
A minor in Psychology consists of five courses: a 100-level introductory course;
PSYCH-201
; one laboratory course numbered between 300 and 327 (except
PSYCH-320
); and two other courses (one of which may be
