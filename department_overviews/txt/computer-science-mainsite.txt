About the Major
The question at the root of computer science is: What can be automated? Hamilton students explore that question through hands-on courses and research. Focusing on both the experimental and theoretical sides of computer science, they also consider the growing place computing has in the modern world. What are the ethical and social risks and benefits of such technology, and how do we manage them?
Students Will Learn To:
Apply core principles of program execution by developing an assembler
Demonstrate knowledge of programming language environments by implementing an interpreter
Solve a given problem by writing an efficient algorithm that uses an appropriate data structure, analyzing its running time, and demonstrating that their algorithm works
Demonstrate their mastery of appropriate programming constructs in written code
A Sampling of Courses
Computer Science for All
The first course in computer science is an introduction to algorithmic problem-solving using the Python programming language. Topics include primitive data types, mathematical operations, structured programming with conditional and iterative idioms, functional abstraction, and objects. Students apply these skills in writing programs to solve problems in domains across the liberal arts. No previous programming experience necessary.
Explore these select courses:
Principles of Programming Languages
Investigation into the nature, features, design and implementation of programming languages. Students will gain experience with a wide variety of programming languages through programming exercises. Topics will include, among others, object-oriented programming, functional programming, higher-order functions, type systems and polymorphism.
Algorithms and Data Structures
A study of fundamental algorithms and data structures from the canon, emphasizing correctness, and trade-offs between techniques, alongside deliberate coverage of topics from discrete mathematics. Topics include running time and space analysis, invariants as a means of proving correctness, and the divide-and-conquer, greedy, and dynamic programming algorithm design paradigms. Specific problems include graph traversals, (optimal) sorting/searching, minimum spanning tree and shortest paths, longest common subsequences, balanced search trees, heaps, hashing, and union-find for disjoint sets.
Computer Organization and Assembly Language
A study of the connection between high-level programs and the machines on which they run by means of extensive programming experience using assembly language. Topics will include translation of high-level language idioms into assembly language, number systems and representation schemes, exceptions, interrupts, polling, and an introduction to the structure of the underlying hardware. In the final project, students develop an assembler.
Developing Accessible User Interfaces
Introduction to access technology and the development of accessible systems. In this course, students build and evaluate various access technologies. This course teaches students the deep inner workings of today’s user interface technology and serves as a guide for building the user interfaces of the future. Topics include: text-to-speech, speech recognition, screen readers, screen magnification, alternative input, tactile displays, and web transformation. Programming intensive.
Computer Networks
This course covers the fundamental concepts of data communication and computer networks. Topics include layered network architecture; reliable data transfer and transport protocols; routing and forwarding; data link layer communications and principles of shared media access. Advanced topics may include physical layer protocols, mobile networks, and software-defined radio networks. Students will apply their understanding of networking fundamentals while working on hands-on programming assignments.
