About the Major
Concentrators pursue two of the following three areas in depth: Ancient Greek, Latin, and Classical Studies. Courses go beyond the traditional study of the languages and cultures of ancient Greece and Rome to provide a broader view of the ancient world and its relation to our own time. The skills students acquire are transferable to a wide variety of contexts.
Students Will Learn To:
Analyze sources, whether textual or material, in their social and historical contexts
Demonstrate comprehension of texts written in the target language (Ancient Greek or Latin)
Compose original scholarly arguments using appropriate research methods and types of evidence
Critically engage with the discipline's history
Productively juxtapose the classical past with modernity
A Sampling of Courses
Pompeii
Provides an interdisciplinary introduction to the field of classical studies, focused through the Roman site of Pompeii and the eruption of Vesuvius in 70 CE. Through Pompeii, its destruction, and its remarkable level of preservation, we will study the art, architecture, archaeology, literature, philosophy, religion, history, daily life, sexuality, food, and social structures of Rome, as well as the place of Rome in the modern imagination. Students will gain a comprehensive overview of the many approaches and sub-disciplines represented within classical studies.
