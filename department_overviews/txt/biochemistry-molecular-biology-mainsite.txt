About the Major
While courses in biology and chemistry introduce students to the life sciences, the Biochemistry/Molecular Biology Program offers scientific grounding for those planning to pursue graduate study or enter the health professions. Through laboratory work and research, students receive practical, hands-on training with opportunities to collaborate with professors on projects that lead to publication in research journals and presentations at scholarly conferences.
Students Will Learn To:
Evaluate the scientific literature and other forms of professional communications in biochemistry and molecular biology
Solve problems at the interfaces of chemistry and biology using scientific reasoning
Communicate fundamental concepts of biochemistry and molecular biology to both expert and layperson in writing and oral presentations
A Sampling of Courses
Biological Chemistry
A survey of the chemical and physical nature of biological macromolecules, including nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates; biochemistry of enzyme catalysis; bioenergetics and regulatory mechanisms. Principles and techniques of experimental biochemistry, focusing on isolation methods and techniques for analyzing structure and function. This course satisfies the second semester of a one-year General Chemistry requirement for post-graduate Health Professions programs, however, this course might not also satisfy a Health Profession program’s requirement for a course in Biochemistry.

Explorations in Biology: The Secret Life of Plants
A thematic course exploring five fundamental features of all biological systems, including structure and function, information flow, energy and matter, interactions, and evolution. Most ecosystems on Earth are shaped by plant life. While it may not seem like it, plants constantly do the same things we do: search for nutrients, secrete hormones, and defend themselves. In this course, we will explore the incredible adaptations plants use to survive and grow, compare these to adaptations of animals, and examine how plants provide the foundation for both ecosystems and human society.
Principles of Chemistry
Exploration of the central principles and theories of chemistry including stoichiometry, thermodynamics, equilibrium, reaction kinetics, and molecular structure and bonding. For students intending to pursue post-graduate work in the Health Professions, this course satisfies the first semester of a one-year General Chemistry requirement.
Physical Chemistry I
A study of the fundamental concepts and principles of quantum chemistry. Topics include the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics, the nature of the chemical bond, and applications of molecular quantum mechanics including spectroscopy and computational electronic structure methods.
Physical Chemistry II
A study of the fundamental concepts and principles of thermodynamics and kinetics. Topics include statistical and classical thermodynamics, prediction of the direction and extent of chemical reactions, equilibrium, chemical kinetics, catalysis, and reaction rate theory.
Biochemistry
The advanced study of biochemical pathways in living organisms, with emphasis given to gene regulation and metabolism of four major macromolecules: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. Includes in-depth discussion of contemporary developments in molecular biology and comprehensive training in molecular techniques. Three hours of class and three hours of laboratory.

It's a Blooming Mystery...
﻿
Two Hamilton chemistry students spent part of their summer unraveling a decades-old campus mystery – the true identity of the beloved peonies in Grant Garden. Saunders left behind scant documentation of what species he used to create his world-renowned hybrids. So, John “JP” Hoak ’27, Mark Khairallah ’27, and Biology Professor Wei-Jen Chang are sleuthing for clues not in records, but in DNA.
Combating Heart Disease Through Chemistry

Life-threatening diseases could become easier to detect thanks to a Hamilton student-faculty research team and its partnership with an internationally recognized biomedical research institute here in Utica.
