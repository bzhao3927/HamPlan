Environmental Studies
The goals of the Hamilton College Environmental Studies Program are to provide students with the knowledge, skills, and interdisciplinary perspectives to understand the causes and consequences of, as well as potential solutions to, the world’s pressing environmental challenges, and to enable them to become environmentally conscious citizens.

About the Major
Environmental Studies addresses the challenges of creating a just and sustainable future in the face of the climate crisis, environmental problems, and inequality from local to global scales. At Hamilton, students in Environmental Studies work with interdisciplinary faculty in environmental justice, environmental data science, and climate change, as well as with faculty from other disciplines to develop the skills and perspectives needed to tackle these problems.
Students Will Learn To:
Explain the causes of, impacts of, and potential solutions to climate change
Analyze how history, power, and identity shape environmental justice
Apply appropriate research methods to answer a research question about a pressing environmental problem
A Sampling of Courses
Changing Arctic Ecosystems
An examination of the primary literature on environmental and climate change in Arctic and sub-Arctic ecosystems. We will investigate the interplay between anthropogenic, physical, and biological processes in high latitude regions. We will explore current research on the cycling of water, carbon and energy throughout high latitude ecosystems and the potential for these regions to amplify global climate change.
Explore these select courses:
Carbon Footprints and Sustainability
What is a carbon footprint? Is it a useful concept? What are the scientific, social and economic implications of measuring environmental impacts through the billion dollar industry of sustainability accounting? In seeking to answer these questions, this course uses the concept of the carbon footprint as a lens through which to understand and critically assess scientific, economic practices and social discourses around sustainability as it is practiced across American and global society today.
Resilience and Collapse: Archaeological Perspectives on People and the Environment
Archaeology offers the opportunity to examine social-ecological systems over long time scales. This course explores different ways of conceptualizing these systems and considers major topics such as: decreasing biodiversity, traditional ecological knowledge, human-environment interactions related to food production, social responses to natural disasters and climate change, and resilience and collapse of past societies. We’ll engage with discussions on sustainability and our ecological impact on the environment.
Environmental Justice
This interdisciplinary seminar examines environmental justice as a movement and concept. We interrogate and discuss the historical role of racism, heteropatriarchy, colonialism and globalization in (re)producing and justifying place-based environmental contamination and toxicity. Through close analysis of case studies in the US and the Global South, students analyze and present on how disenfranchised groups have made political demands, scaled up, forged solidarities, asserted climate justice, challenged state and corporate projects and conducted citizen science in rural and urban settings.
Political Theory and the Environment
What should humanity’s relationship with the environment look like, and why? Explores theoretical and practical debates surrounding the environmental challenges of our time. Key topics and controversies in the history of environmental political thought will be discussed. Students will be encouraged to develop their own vision of the proper relationship between human society and the environment in the 21st century.
Environmental Data Science
This course will focus on the application of statistical programming for big data associated with ongoing environmental issues. Students will gain experience in statistical programming throughout the entire data life cycle including data management and provenance, analysis, visualization, and communication. Students will learn the fundamentals of applying statistical modelling and machine learning for making predictions and inferences for environmental data. Students will also learn considerations of data science that are unique to environmental data including spatial, temporal, ethical, and justice concerns. Environmental topics will include climate change, pollution, natural disasters, and agricultural impacts.

Hockey Team Scores for Climate Action
﻿
Winning a NESCAC championship requires a bit of travel, and climate action requires a bit of cooperation. Carson Hall ’26 and Ben Zimmerman ’26 understand this, and are doing something about it. On a Saturday in early September, the men’s hockey team planted over 50 trees in Utica. The initiative seeks to offset the emissions of athletics travel.
