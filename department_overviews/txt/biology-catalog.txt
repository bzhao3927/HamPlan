Department/Program Goals
The goal of the Biology Department is to inspire and prepare our students for lifelong learning as professionals in the biological sciences and as scientifically informed citizens, as well as to advance understanding of the natural world through original research.
Department/Program Student Learning Outcomes
Students Will Learn to:
Analyze and interpret original and published biological data
Apply the scientific method in a way that demonstrates comprehension
Communicate effectively about fundamental biological concepts using scientific language
Concentration/Minor Description and Requirements
A concentration in biology consists of 11 credits, including nine credits in biology and two credits in chemistry. The class of 2024 must additionally complete one credit related to science in society. Biology courses must include
BIO-100
, at least four additional (upper-level) Biology courses with laboratories, and
BIO-550
. At least one upper-level lab course must be selected from within each of the following curricular categories: Cell and Molecular Biology (
BIO-211
,
BIO-212
,
BIO-221
, BIO-248,
BIO-249
,
BIO-260
,
BIO-270
,
BIO-334
,
BIO-346
,
BIO-357
), Organismal Biology (
BIO-213
,
BIO-222
,
BIO-228
,
BIO-311
,
BIO-330
,
BIO-331
,
BIO-334
,
BIO-335
,
BIO-340
), and Ecology and Evolution (
BIO-212
,
BIO-213
,
BIO-228
,
BIO-237
,
BIO-250
,
BIO-290
). Courses listed in more than one category can only be counted toward fulfilling the requirement in one. To meet the Social, Structural, and Institutional Hierarchies college requirement, students must take three biology courses that carry the SSIH designation. Chemistry courses must include
CHEM-120
and
CHEM-190
.
With prior departmental approval, up to one SSIH course can be taken from outside the department if the course addresses issues in biology or science in general. For the class of 2024, the science and society course must discuss issues in public policy or ethics related to science or technology, and be approved by the department. With prior departmental approval, up to two credits may be transferred into the concentration from study off-campus. No more than one credit of independent study may be applied to the concentration. Before a student declares a biology concentration, up to one concentration course credit may be taken credit/no credit. Students preparing for graduate studies in biology should take at least one year each of calculus and organic chemistry, and should have knowledge of statistics. Departmental honors are determined on the basis of distinguished achievement in coursework and in the Senior Thesis (both
BIO-550
and
BIO-551
, or
BIO-550
and an exceptional research record at Hamilton).
A minor in biology consists of five biology courses, which must include
BIO-100
and at least one course at the 300 level or higher.
BIO-214
does not count toward a concentration or minor in biology.
