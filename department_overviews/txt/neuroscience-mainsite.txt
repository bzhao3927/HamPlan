About the Major
The brain is our most fascinating and complicated organ, and it governs the very nature of our conscious existence. Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system, and includes many disciplines, including biology, chemistry, and psychology. In addition, the study of neuroscience helps students to understand the interrelationships between the basic sciences and concepts in philosophy, mathematics, and computer science.
Students Will Learn To:
Engage in scientific inquiries that are informed by ethical and/or socio-cultural perspectives
Communicate ideas effectively and concisely
Integrate scientific literature to develop neuroscientific research questions
Apply appropriate scientific methods to address neuroscientific research questions
Demonstrate an interdisciplinary understanding of the nervous system
A Sampling of Courses
Sensation and Perception
An exploration of sensory systems and perceptual experiences. This course will address how we obtain information from our physical environment and use it to create the vibrant experience of our own bodies and the world around us. An emphasis on vision, but also covering audition, somatosensation, olfaction and gustation. Topics will include methodological approaches, sensory pathways and neurobiological mechanisms, disorders, illusions and multi-sensory interactions.
Explore these select courses:
Fundamentals of Neurobiology
Introduction to the field of neuroscience from a biological perspective. In-depth examination of fundamental concepts in neurobiology designed to introduce students to the electrophysiological, chemical and anatomical features of neurons, brain regions and brain circuits. Investigation of the neurobiological basis of behavior through exploration of topics such as neuronal communication, neuroanatomy, sensory and motor systems, learning, motivation, and behavior disorders.
Psychology and Neuroscience of Learning
An exploration of theoretical and methodological questions involved in the study of learning and neural plasticity. Questions covered will include: What is learning? What are the mechanisms that support neural plasticity, and how do they contribute to learning-induced changes in behavior? How does learning change across the lifespan? Laboratory exercises will include the development of original experiments to elicit and measure learning at the behavioral and neural levels, as well as the analysis of neural data. Three hours of class and three hours of laboratory.
Stress and Psychophysiology
A theoretical and methodological exploration of the psychological and physiological mechanisms of stress. Questions will include: How does psychological stress impact health and well-being? What neurobiological mechanisms are involved? What is the role of environmental context? Laboratory exercises will include designing original experiments to examine the role of stress on behavior and physiological activity, as well as analyzing data, writing papers based on findings, and oral and poster presentations. Three hours of class and three hours of laboratory.
Neurobiology of Addiction
This course is centered on understanding the neurobiology of the "addicted brain." Strong emphasis on the neurobiological effects of drugs of abuse, including short and longer-term changes in the brain and body that occur in response to drug use and abuse. A sampling of drugs to be discussed include cocaine, heroin, marijuana, hallucinogens and alcohol. Effectiveness of various treatment strategies will also be considered. Some discussion of the social, political and philosophical aspects of addiction to drug and non-drug substances (e.g., food compulsions and pathological gambling).

Strong Mentorship Leads Yuxuan Xu ’26 to Goldwater Scholarship
﻿
Yuxuan Xu ’26 has been named a recipient of the prestigious Barry Goldwater Scholarship, a national award that supports students intending to pursue research careers in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering. For Xu, the recognition wasn’t just a validation of his work — it was a meaningful milestone after years of dedicated effort and strong mentorship at Hamilton.
Trailblazing First-Gens Share Experiences
﻿
In celebration of National First-Gen Student Week, we are recognizing our many students who identify as “first-generation” — the first in their families to complete or pursue a bachelor’s degree. Alejandro Sosa Hernández ’26 recently interviewed several of our first-gens to get their thoughts on being college trailblazers.
