Geosciences
The goal of the Geosciences Department is to ensure that students are actively engaged in developing a broad and deep background in how the Earth works, in analyzing compelling and relevant questions from a geoscience perspective, and in communicating their work effectively in order to prepare them to make better personal and professional decisions involving Earth-related issues.

About the Major
Whether a student wants to be a geoscientist or pursue another career path, Hamilton’s geoscience program gives them the foundation to better understand our geologically active planet. Students work closely and collaboratively with professors and fellow students in the lab and field to study modern active geological processes and the archive of past Earth processes in the rock record. They gain experience in collecting, analyzing, and interpreting critical data, and in communicating essential ideas both to advance science and to make a difference for our future Earth.
Students Will Learn To:
Evaluate, using reliable sources, the current state of knowledge, major controversies, and unknowns about a geoscience topic
Collect appropriate data to solve geologic problems
Defend arguments with evidence
Effectively communicate to a variety of audiences the geological ideas and data that inform decision-making involving geoscience issues
A Sampling of Courses
Advanced Hydrogeology and the Environment
Advanced topics in hydrogeology, including geochemical principles, an introduction to contaminant transport, computer modeling of groundwater flow and studies of landfills, hazardous waste sites and other environmental problems. Three hours of class and two hour lab/discussion with field trips.
Explore these select courses:
Principles of Geoscience: Earth Resources and the Environment
A study of Earth’s mineral deposits and energy resources, their distribution, origin, economic significance, and the environmental impact of their extraction and consumption. Not open to students who have taken any other course in Principles of Geology. Maximum enrollment 24. Bailey
Paleoenvironmental Reconstruction: Applications of Sedimentology and Stratigraphy
This course focused on how the fundamentals of sedimentology and stratigraphy can be used to reconstruct past environments and study how they change through time. This will include a study of the classification of siliciclastic and carbonate rocks, how the energy of systems controls the type of rocks deposited, and the paleoclimatic/tectonic significance of depositional sequences. Three hours of class and three hours of laboratory with field trips.
Drones and Phones: Seminar on New Tools for Geologic Field Work and Data Collection
Digital data collection using UAVs and smart phones has become an important tool for geologists to develop high resolution images and 3-D models of field terrains and outcrops. In this seminar, students will have a hands-on, in-depth experience with the methods, uses, and limitations of Structure from Motion photogrammetry in geoscience field work and research.
Meteorology
This course is an introduction to the fundamental forces that drive weather systems and patterns in the atmosphere. Topics include the properties of the atmosphere, the jet stream, air masses and fronts, cloud development, the energy cycle, and how they influence weather. These concepts will be applied to a variety of weather systems such as thunderstorms, hurricanes, lake effect snow, and tornadoes.
Field Studies in the Desert Southwest
A field study of the geology of southern and central Arizona. Emphasis will be placed on examining evidence of large-scale geologic processes and how humans interact with, are influenced by, and modify the natural environment. A 10-day, intensive field course emphasizing experiential learning. Course will involve moderate hiking in remote areas.
