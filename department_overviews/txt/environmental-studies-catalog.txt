Department/Program Goals
The goals of the Hamilton College Environmental Studies Program are to provide students with the knowledge, skills, and interdisciplinary perspectives to understand the causes and consequences of, as well as potential solutions to, the worldâs pressing environmental challenges, and to enable them to become environmentally conscious citizens.
Department/Program Student Learning Outcomes
Students will learn to:
Explain the causes of, impacts of, and potential solutions to climate change
Analyze how history, power, and identity shape environmental justice
Apply appropriate research methods to answer a research question about a pressing environmental problem
Concentration/Minor Description and Requirements
This interdisciplinary program includes its own faculty and is also supported by contributions of faculty members from a number of other departments.
The Concentration in Environmental Studies
The Environmental Studies concentration consists of 11 courses: 4 required core courses, 4 foundational breadth courses, and 3 electives, and the Senior Program.
There are four core required courses for concentrators:
ENVST-110
Intro to Environmental Studies,
ENVST-206
Introduction to Environmental Data,
ENVST-212
Climate Change, and
ENVST-234
Environmental Justice. These are normally taken in the first or second year.
ENVST-234
fulfills the Social Structural and Institutional Hierarchies requirement for the concentration. If students have taken
ECON-166
,
MATH-152
, or
MATH-254
, they must take
ENVST-325
Environmental Data Science instead of
ENVST-206
to fulfill the core requirement.
Students are required to fulfill four breadth requirements by selecting ONE course from each of the following two categories: 1. Earth Science: Any 100-Level Geoscience course; 2. Life Science: Any
BIO-100
course or
CHEM-120
; and any TWO courses from the following category: 3. Environmental Social Sciences and Humanities:
ENVST-221
Environment and the CIty,
ENVST-285
Environmental Politics,
ENVST-287
Environmental Political Theory,
ENVST-290
Nature and Technology,
ECON-380
: Environmental Economics,
ENVST-218
: Resilience and Collapse,
ENVST-266
: Global Environmental History,
LIT-267
: Literature and the Environment,
PHIL-235
: Environmental Ethics. We strongly recommend that at least two foundational breadth courses should be taken during the first year: an introductory (100-level) Geosciences course and Biology-100/
CHEM-120
.
All concentrators must also take three electives from the approved list below of ENVST and other environmentally related courses. Upon declaring their concentration, students should meet with their concentration advisor to discuss a focal area of study to help guide the selection of elective courses in the major. Students are encouraged to align their electives thematically around a topic, but the requirement is simply three courses from the list.
• No more than one 100 level course
• At least one 300 level course
• May include up to TWO transfers from study abroad programs.
• Additional foundational course options for Environmental Social Sciences and Environmental Humanities listed above CAN be counted as electives toward the major
Approved ENVST Electives
Note: Courses not appearing on this list but which were previously designated ENVST at the time that the student took them will count as electives.
