Department/Program Goals
The goal of Hamilton's Cinema and Media Studies Program is to blend study in film and media history and theory while providing students opportunities to pursue their own artistic visions through the uses of new technology.
Department/Program Student Learning Outcomes
Students Will Learn to:
Analyze films and other media, regardless of genre, context, language, and geographical origin, for their structure, approach, goals, social and political implications, and aesthetics
Apply knowledge of the overall development and history of cinema and media, from a global perspective, in written and spoken work
Produce creative work in forms employed in cinema and media studies
Demonstrate knowledge of contexts, outside of the specific focus of media, within which cinema and media studies play a role
Concentration/Minor Description and Requirements
Hamiltonâs Cinema and Media Studies Program offers opportunities to explore cinema and media history and theory through in-depth, broadly ranging exposure to pivotal contributions and accomplishments in media-making, as well as through hands-on creative experiences. The focus of the concentration is to develop critical perspectives on the aesthetics, structures, and impacts of visual representations and new media technologies.
A concentration in Cinema and Media Studies (CNMS) consists of ten courses:
three required courses and seven additional courses
. The three required courses are:
CNMS-120
(this course satisfies the Collegeâs Social, Structural, and Institutional Hierarchies requirement),
CNMS-301
, and
CNMS-500
. In addition, students must complete: three Theory/Genre courses, one Production course, one World Cinemas course, and two electives. (See lists below for each of these categories.)
Honors in CNMS is awarded to concentrators with at least a 3.7 average in the concentration and who complete
CNMS-550
with a grade of at least A-.
A minor in Cinema and Media Studies comprises five courses:
CNMS-120
and either four courses from the Theory/Genre list below, or three courses from the Theory/Genre list and one production course.
Important:
All interdisciplinary majors require careful planning since courses depend on the offerings of individual departments and may change year by year. Courses taught in a language other than English are noted as such in the lists below. While several courses listed below are not crosslisted with CNMS (i.e. they do not have a CNMS number), they may still count toward the concentration and minor. Youâll find that some courses appear under multiple categories; however, they may only count once toward your concentration or minor. That is, a single course cannot be used to fulfill multiple requirements at once. Last but not least, to confirm whether a course that is not listed below will count toward the concentration or minor, please speak with your advisor or the director of the Cinema and Media Studies program.
