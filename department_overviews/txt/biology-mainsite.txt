Biology
The goal of the Biology Department is to inspire and prepare our students for lifelong learning as professionals in the biological sciences and as scientifically informed citizens, as well as to advance understanding of the natural world through original research.

About the Major
At all levels, biology at Hamilton aims to offer a stimulating, thought-provoking experience, and classes are small. The emphasis on lab work and research gives students ample opportunities to apply what they learn outside the classroom. Many pursue summer research with professors, and all biology majors complete a research project through the Senior Program.
Students Will Learn To:
Analyze and interpret original and published biological data
Apply the scientific method in a way that demonstrates comprehension
Communicate effectively about fundamental biological concepts using scientific language
A Sampling of Courses
Explorations in Biology: The Secret Life of Plants
A thematic course exploring five fundamental features of all biological systems, including structure and function, information flow, energy and matter, interactions, and evolution. Most ecosystems on Earth are shaped by plant life. While it may not seem like it, plants constantly do the same things we do: search for nutrients, secrete hormones, and defend themselves. In this course, we will explore the incredible adaptations plants use to survive and grow, compare these to adaptations of animals, and examine how plants provide the foundation for both ecosystems and human society.
Explore these select courses:
Biodiversity: Crisis and Solutions
Biodiversity is one of our planet's most striking features, and both natural ecosystems and human society are structured by diversity in genes, species, and habitats. In lecture, we will explore global patterns of biodiversity and the biological processes driving these patterns. Additionally, we
will examine how people are threatening biodiversity across the planet, causing a new mass extinction event. For each threat to biodiversity, we will also discuss conservation and restoration strategies that can be used to protect biodiversity. In lab, we will quantify biodiversity in campus forests, and develop recommendations to guide the college's conservation and restoration efforts.
Developmental Genetics
In this course we will integrate classical genetics, epigenetics, cell and molecular biology, and organismal approaches to the study of development. We will analyze a diversity of mechanisms, ranging from ones that set up pattern formation in the unfertilized egg to those governing morphogenesis of organ systems. Topics covered include embryogenesis, gene regulation, axis specification, morphogen signaling, stem cells, cloning, limb formation, and sex determination, as well as congenital defects and issues in human development.
Cellular Neurobiology
A study of the fundamental functions of eukaryotic cells. The interrelationships of cellular structure and function, the cell cycle, protein trafficking and cellular communication will be examined through the study of neurons, the basic unit of the nervous system. Additional topics will include specialized activities of neurons. Three hours class and three hours of laboratory.
Seminar in Disease and Behavior
The relationship between animal behavior and disease is bidirectional: behavior can affect the likelihood of acquiring a disease, and disease can subsequently alter behavior. In this class, we examine the fundamentals of animal behavior (e.g., sexual selection, kin selection, social evolution, communication and signals, reproductive strategies) and apply them to current research on the ecology and evolution of disease. Discussion of foundational readings and the primary literature.
Seminar in Bioinformatics
Study of computer-based approaches to molecular investigations: sequence variation, molecular evolution, functional and comparative genomics, and computational biology. Both literature-based lecture and training on the use of bioinformatic software are included.
