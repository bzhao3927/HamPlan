About the Major
At Hamilton, psychology students are introduced to a breadth of topics (e.g., clinical, cognitive, developmental, evolutionary, neuroscience, and social) while also gaining a strong foundation in research methodology and statistics. Students have opportunities to apply their knowledge, such as through research with a professor or at the
New England Center for Children
, a treatment facility for individuals with autism. From introductory courses through the Senior Project, students learn to use the scientific method to pursue questions about human nature.
Students Will Learn To:
Explain how behavior and the mind are shaped by a variety of factors (e.g., biological, sociocultural)
Evaluate sources, evidence, and psychological theories critically
Employ appropriate research methods and statistics to address novel psychological questions ethically
Communicate ideas clearly and concisely, demonstrating awareness of both disciplinary conventions and the target audience
A Sampling of Courses
Psychology and Neuroscience of Learning
An exploration of theoretical and methodological questions involved in the study of learning and neural plasticity. Questions covered will include: What is learning? What are the mechanisms that support neural plasticity, and how do they contribute to learning-induced changes in behavior? How does learning change across the lifespan? Laboratory exercises will include the development of original experiments to elicit and measure learning at the behavioral and neural levels, as well as the analysis of neural data. Three hours of class and three hours of laboratory.
Explore these select courses:
Developmental Psychology of Self-Control
Theoretical and methodological examination of the psychological processes involved in regulating thoughts, behavior, and emotions. Emphasis on childhood and adolescence. Questions covered will include: What is executive function and how does it develop? What are the consequences of low or delayed self-control abilities across the lifespan? How can we improve self-control? Data collection, statistical analysis, papers based on findings, oral and poster presentations. Three hours of class and three hours of laboratory.
Stress and Psychophysiology
A theoretical and methodological exploration of the psychological and physiological mechanisms of stress. Questions will include: How does psychological stress impact health and well-being? What neurobiological mechanisms are involved? What is the role of environmental context? Laboratory exercises will include designing original experiments to examine the role of stress on behavior and physiological activity, as well as analyzing data, writing papers based on findings, and oral and poster presentations. Three hours of class and three hours of laboratory.
The Evolved Mind
This course will explore the interactive relationships among evolved adaptations, development, learning, and culture, emphasizing ways in which these work together to shape individuals’ behavior. Questions covered will include: What does it mean to take an evolutionary approach to psychology? What are the major evolutionary theories, and how have they been used to explain human behavior? What are the methods and assumptions of evolutionary approaches?
Stereotyping and Prejudice
In this course we will take a social psychological approach to understanding stereotypes, prejudice(s), and discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and other group memberships. We will examine classic and contemporary theories and research on topics such as cognitive, motivational, evolutionary, and sociocultural explanations of prejudice; modern forms of prejudice/implicit bias; the impact of prejudice and discrimination on targets of prejudice; and prejudice reduction.
Field Study in Psychology
Seminar in psychological services combined with eight to ten hours per week of field study in one of several cooperating local agencies and schools. Extensive written project addressing theoretical issues relevant to field work. Topics include methods in provision of psychological, educational and applied services, and methodological and ethical issues in psychotherapy, counseling and educational psychology.
