Department/Program Goals
The goal of the Chemical Physics Program is to encourage students to make connections across the chemistry and physics disciplines through extensive research opportunities and close collaboration between students and instructors.
Concentration/Minor Description and Requirements
The departments of Chemistry and Physics jointly offer a concentration in chemical physics. The concentration consists of 11 courses in chemistry and physics, which include
CHEM-120
or CHEM-125,
CHEM-190
,
CHEM-321
and
CHEM-322
;
PHYS-190
,
PHYS-195
,
PHYS-290
and
PHYS-295
. Any one of
PHYS-215
,
CHEM-348
or
PHYS-348
fulfills the Social, Structural, and Institutional Hierarchies requirement in chemical physics.  Students must also complete a course in research methods in one of the departments, either
CHEM-371
or
PHYS-390
, followed by a Senior Project, chosen in consultation with the committee, in the appropriate department.
MATH-113
and
MATH-116
are required for 200-level classes in physics and 300-level classes in chemistry. Honors in chemical physics is based on outstanding work in courses and in the Senior Project.
