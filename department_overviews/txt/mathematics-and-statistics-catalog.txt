Department/Program Goals
The goal of the Mathematics and Statistics Department is to enable students to analyze and organize information using quantitative and statistical tools, to reason and argue logically, to employ appropriate problem-solving strategies, and to communicate complex ideas clearly and efficiently.
Department/Program Student Learning Outcomes
Students Will Learn to:
Use mathematical and/or statistical tools to model real-world problems
Construct mathematical proofs based on rules of logical inference
Communicate complete mathematical and/or statistical arguments
Concentration/Minor Description and Requirements
A concentration in mathematics consists of the courses
MATH-116
,
MATH-216
,
MATH-224
,
MATH-314
,
MATH-325
, a Senior Seminar, and three full-credit electives, of which at least one must be at the 300 level or higher. Concentrators fulfill the Senior Program requirement by taking a Senior Seminar. It must be taken in the fall of the studentâs senior year, and all lower-numbered required courses, with at most one exception, should be completed prior to that time.
PHYS-320
or
PHYS-325
, but not both, may be counted toward the concentration as an elective at the 200-level. Among the courses counted for the concentration must be one that is applied in focus; these courses are
MATH-152
,
MATH-231
,
MATH-234
,
MATH-235
,
MATH-254
,
MATH-260
,
MATH-351
,
MATH-361
,
MATH-510
,
MATH-525
,
PHYS-320
or
PHYS-325
. Concentrators are encouraged to take an introductory course in computer programming, such as
CPSCI-101
. Mathematical thinking and programming mutually reinforce each other, and many careers involving quantitative skills also require some experience with programming.
At most one course taken on a CR/NC basis may be applied towards the concentration; this course may not be one in the Mathematics and Statistics Department that is numbered 224 or higher.
Beginning with the class of 2020, students concentrating in mathematics must satisfy the Social, Structural, and Institutional Hierarchies requirement by completing one of
MATH-254
,
MATH-260
,
MATH-498
,
ECON-166
, HIST-226 or, for those interested in pursuing a career in education,
EDUC-204
,
EDUC-206
,
EDUC-339
or EDUC-415. Students who have not completed one of these courses may petition the department to accept a course in another department as fulfilling the SSIH requirement by providing a written rationale explaining how the proposed course will help them gain an understanding of social, structural, and institutional hierarchies that is relevant to mathematics and their post-graduation plans.
Students may earn departmental honors by taking for a grade a fourth full-credit elective that is at the 300 level or higher, by obtaining a concentration average of 3.6 or higher, and by making an approved and high-quality public presentation to the department on a mathematical or statistical topic during their junior or senior year. The presentation topic must be an extension beyond previous course work.
A minor in mathematics consists of
MATH-116
,
MATH-216
,
MATH-224
and two electives. At most one course taken on a CR/NC basis may be applied towards the minor; this course may not be one in the Mathematics and Statistics Department that is numbered 224 or higher.
A minor in statistics consists of five courses:
MATH-116
,
MATH-216
,
MATH-152
,
MATH-254
and
MATH-351
. Students may substitute
ECON-166
,
GOVT-230
or
PSYCH-201
/
NEURO-201
for 152. Students may use Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or A-level courses to count for only one of the five courses. Students with two or more such courses, or who want to count
ECON-166
,
GOVT-230
, or
PSYCH-201
/
NEURO-201
toward a concentration or another minor, may complete the minor in statistics by taking
CPSCI-101
,
ENVST-222
,
ENVST-325
,
MATH-352
,
MATH-356
, or
GOVT-412
, up to a total of five courses, of which at least four must be in the Mathematics and Statistics Department. Students in this situation may petition the department to accept a course other than those listed here by providing a written rationale explaining the relevance of the proposed course to statistics. A student with a concentration in mathematics or data science may not minor in statistics. At most one course taken on a CR/NC basis may be applied towards the minor; this course may not be one in the Mathematics and Statistics Department that is numbered 224 or higher.
