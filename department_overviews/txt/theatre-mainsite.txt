About the Major
Theatre at Hamilton is a dynamic, challenging community that aims to awaken and cultivate every student’s creative potential and presence. Students learn, create, and perform in the new Kennedy Center for Theatre and the Studio Arts, and faculty help them develop their own identity through classes, workshops, projects, and productions that are innovative — and often provocative. Students may major in theatre or minor in theatre or design and production. Majors maintain high academic and artistic standards as they work on individual and collaborative projects.
Students Will Learn To:
Exhibit competence in production/design of theatre
Exhibit competence in acting/directing of theatrical performances
Analyze plays/productions as aesthetic/cultural productions related to institutional and social hierarchies

Costume Design: History into Practice
This studio-type course serves as an introduction to the theory and practice of costume design for theater, film and television. Through a series of lectures, demonstrations and projects students will explore various aspects of costume history and the costume design process. Specific attention will be given to fashion silhouettes and historical periods, as they relate to the assigned texts. Areas covered in the course will include, costume history, script analysis, textiles, life drawing and watercolor rendering.
Outrageous Acts: Avant-Garde Theatre and Performance Art
How does avant-garde theatre utilize shock as a strategy to lead us to see ourselves from new and unexpected perspectives? How are issues of colonialism and appropriation embedded in the evolution of the avant-garde? How does it simultaneously reflect and rebel against the social hierarchies from which it sprang? Through research and performance we will examine the historical, cultural and philosophical origins and influences of avant-garde theatre, as well as exemplary works from the early avant-garde movements (1890-1940) and more contemporary theatre and performance art (1950-1990), including Surrealism, Symbolism, Expressionism, Dada, Futurism, Constructivism, and Epic, as well as The Living Theatre, Grotowski, Monk, Wilson, Foreman, and The Wooster Group.
Advanced Acting Workshop: Shakespeare and Company
Classical texts and contemporary performance. Focus on Shakespeare, language and character. May include other classical dramatists Scene and monologue work, textual analysis, vocal and speaking preparedness, verse and heightened speech, characterization, improvisation and rehearsals.
