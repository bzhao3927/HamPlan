Department/Program Goals
The goal of the Philosophy Department is to work with students to develop the skills of critical analysis, powerful speaking, and clear writing, skills alumni find of singular practical use in a wide variety of careers, and indispensable to their work as responsible citizens. We emphasize the value of philosophical examination for understanding broad issues that concern us all.
Department/Program Student Learning Outcomes
Students Will Learn to:
Explain a range of philosophical views, historical and contemporary
Identify philosophical problems in philosophy, other academic disciplines, or outside the academy
Formulate their own views about philosophical problems in conversation with other philosophical works
Defend those views cogently in writing and in speech
Concentration/Minor Description and Requirements
The concentration in philosophy consists of nine courses:
PHIL-201
,
PHIL-203
, and
PHIL-550
; and
One logic course: either
PHIL-100
,
PHIL-200
, or
PHIL-240
; and
Three additional courses at the 400 level, no more than one of which may be transferred from outside of Hamilton College; and
Two electives in philosophy.
Concentrators must also satisfy the Social, Structural, and Institutional Hierarchies (SSIH) requirement in a course so designated. Concentrators may satisfy the SSIH requirement with a course they are counting toward the concentration requirements 1-4 above. Courses from outside of Hamilton may fulfill the SSIH requirement at the discretion of the chair.
No more than one of the nine courses counted toward the concentration may be at the 100 level. Any course may be taken credit/no credit for the concentration or minor except 550.

Senior concentrators complete the Senior Seminar (
