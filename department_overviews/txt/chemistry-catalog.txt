Department/Program Goals
For all students, whether through coursework or research, the Chemistry Department fosters the development of creativity, rigor, and flexibility in problem solving along with the ability to communicate ideas and processes with clarity and precision in the context of chemistry.
Department/Program Student Learning Outcomes
Students Will Learn to:
Apply scientific reasoning to explain chemical phenomena as evidenced by performance on a standardized exam (breadth of chemical reasoning)
Demonstrate the ability to conduct a sustained research project (chemical research)
Communicate chemistryâs impact on society with attention to ethics and inequities in science from which science policy decisions are made (impact of chemistry)
Concentration/Minor Description and Requirements
A concentration in chemistry consists of 9.5 credits including the following courses:
CHEM-120
;
CHEM-190
;
CHEM-255
;
CHEM-263
,
CHEM-265
or
CHEM-270
;
CHEM-321
or
CHEM-322
;
CHEM-325
;
CHEM-348
;
CHEM-371
; one additional credit at the 300- or 400-level; and
CHEM-551
or CHEM-552. In addition, calculus through
MATH-116
and two semesters of physics (calculus-based physics recommended) are prerequisites for
CHEM-321
and
CHEM-322
. Students who are considering a concentration in chemistry are strongly encouraged to enroll in
CHEM-120
in their first semester.
We believe that our students need to be aware how historical contributions of underrepresented groups in science illuminate inequalities of opportunity to contribute to science and technology, that a diversity of perspectives are crucial to science when dealing with complex problems, that the impact of science is both local and global, and that science policy decisions are made in the real world in which biases might be hidden. Concentrators satisfy the Social, Structural, and Institutional Hierarchies requirement by completing
CHEM-348
.
Students who plan to pursue graduate work or employment in chemistry or a related science are encouraged to satisfy the requirements for a degree certified by the American Chemical Society (ACS). Starting with the Class of 2025, in order to qualify for an ACS certified degree, students must take
CHEM-263
,
CHEM-265
and
CHEM-270
, in addition to satisfying all other concentration requirements. Students who plan to attend graduate school in chemistry or chemically related fields are advised to take both
CHEM-321
and
CHEM-322
. We invite all interested students to attend the departmental seminar series, which is a required part of
CHEM-371
,
CHEM-551
and CHEM-552. Departmental honors are determined on the basis of distinguished coursework in chemistry (normally a minimum GPA of 3.7) and excellence in the Senior Thesis. Candidates for Honors should elect both 551 and 552.
A minor in chemistry consists of five credits, at least one credit must be at the 300-level or above.
CHEM-298
may not be counted towards satisfying the requirements for the minor. The minimum requirement in chemistry for preparation for medical school consists of
CHEM-120
;
CHEM-190
and
CHEM-255
; and one additional course at the 200-level (
CHEM-263
,
CHEM-265
, or
CHEM-270
). Students who take
CHEM-270
as their additional 200-level course may also need to take
BIO-346
to satisfy medical schoolsâ Biochemistry requirement.
