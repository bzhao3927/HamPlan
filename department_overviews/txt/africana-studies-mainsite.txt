Africana Studies
The goal of the Africana Studies department is to take up the field's central questions and debates in multiple contexts and by means of multiple methodologies.
In keeping with this goal, many of the department’s course offerings focus extensively and transdisciplinarily on issues of social, structural, and institutional hierarchy as they pertain to race and a host of other dimensions of identity.

About the Major
Hamilton’s Africana studies faculty and students represent a wide range of racial and ethnic backgrounds, bringing to the classroom a diversity of experiences, perspectives, and disciplinary strengths. Students often spend a summer conducting research with a professor; some have earned fellowships to continue their academic work abroad after graduation.
Students Will Learn To:
Apply at least two disciplinary lenses of analysis that focus on a specific aspect of the life experiences of people of African descent (for example in written/digital assignments, performative or oral presentations)
Explain, verbally and/or in writing, the interrelationships among people from sub-Saharan Africa, the United States, the Caribbean, Latin America, or other parts of the African diaspora in two or more of the following areas: linguistic, intellectual, political, economic, or cultural
Define and provide examples of colonization, decolonization, Black liberation/power movements and their legacies
Explain, verbally and/or in writing, the concept of intersectionality via specific connections with race, ethnicity, class, and gender
Explain the goals of one or more current social justice initiatives involving people of African descent in the United States and globally
A Sampling of Courses
Exploring Social Justice
This course explores the historical movements for social justice and contributions of a new generation of black leadership including students, women and community organizers during the civil rights and Black power movements. We will consider the contributions of well-known figures like Huey Newton and Malcolm X and lesser-known figures like Septima Clark, the director of the freedom schools, and their significance in the present times.
Explore these select courses:
Representation, Culture, and Power
Forefronts the consequences of assumptions based on hegemonic ideas and representations of blackness and Black life. We examine how visual and narrative representations impact our perceptions and sense of collective and individual selves, and the lived experiences of Black subjects. We explore dominant cultural representations of blackness and how they are in dialogue, negotiation, and contestation, along with the tension and interaction between ideas inherited from the outside, and the created inner ones.
Racism and Anti-racism
Our present age demands we explore the theory and practice of anti-racist work through an examination of the foundational construction of race and racism in America and the resistance of abolitionists like Frederick Douglass, John Brown, Frances Seward, and others; the role of white supremacy, and anti-blackness. This course also seeks to answer questions like: What is anti-racism? Taking a dialectical approach to such questions we will explore work by anti-racism scholars and activists such as Ibram X. Kendi; the Black Panthers; James Baldwin; and recent critical writing on white supremacy.
Global African Social Movements
An interdisciplinary introduction to global social and political movements in Africa and the Americas from the Revolutions at the end of the 18th century to the present. Addresses theories of social movements, their racial and cultural formation, the variations in type and consequences of movements, and the contexts in which they arose. These contexts include the intersectionality of race, class and gender within persisting historical & racial hierarchies. Movements examined include the anti-slavery movement; the Pan-Africanist movement, the women’s movement and the rise of modern NGOs.
