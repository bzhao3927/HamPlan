Department/Program Goals
The goal of the Geoarchaeology Program is to encourage connections between geological concepts and methods to aid in the interpretation of the archaeological record of past societies.
Department/Program Student Learning Outcomes
Students Will Learn to:
Engage with disciplinary fundamentals from anthropological archaeology
Engage with disciplinary fundamentals from geosciences
Combine practice and methodology through research design
Apply disciplinary perspective(s) in an original research project
Concentration/Minor Description and Requirements
Geoarchaeology uses geologic methods and principles to enhance interpretations of the archaeological record, focusing on such issues as geochronology and stratigraphic succession, processes of deposition and diagenesis, paleoenvironmental reconstruction and landscape evolution. Designed for students with shared interests in geology and archaeology, the concentration builds on the common histories and research domains of these fields.
A concentration in geoarchaeology consists of 10 units of credit taken from the existing curricula of the Anthropology and Geosciences departments. Required courses include:
ARCH-106
and any 100-level Geoscience course;
ARCH-325
; two courses from
ARCH-243
,
ARCH-245
or
ARCH-249
;
GEOSC-211
; two courses from
GEOSC-220
,
GEOSC-236
or
GEOSC-290
; and GEARC-500 and GEARC-501. Concentrators must fulfill their senior project requirement through satisfactory completion of GEARC-500 and GEARC-501. Beginning with the class of 2020, students concentrating in Geoarchaeology will satisfy the Social, Structural, and Institutional Hierarchies requirement by completing the requirement offered in either Anthropology, Geosciences, or both. Honors will be awarded on the basis of excellence in coursework and a superior Senior Project.
Students are encouraged to take field courses in both disciplines, especially
ARCH-281
and
ARCH-282
. Students considering careers in geoarchaeology or related fields should take additional courses in biology, chemistry and other sciences.
