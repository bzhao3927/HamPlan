Department/Program Goals
The goal of the Economics Department is to educate engaged citizens who understand the economic institutions they are part of and who are able to assess and develop opportunities for responsible participation and positive social change.
Department/Program Student Learning Outcomes
Students Will Learn to:
Design a research plan to address an economic question
Competently implement a research plan
Communicate findings from the research plan
Concentration/Minor Description and Requirements
A concentration in economics consists of nine economics courses. The economics courses must include five core courses and four elective courses. The five core courses are
ECON-100
,
ECON-166
,
ECON-266
,
ECON-275
, and
ECON-285
.
MATH-113
or its equivalent is one of the prerequisites for
ECON-275
. At least one elective must be at the 400-level and at least one must be at the 500-level and taken as a senior. Economics concentrators may not take any full-credit course offered by the Economics Department at the 200-level or higher on a CR/NC basis. Economics concentrators can apply, at most, one 100-level course taken on a CR/NC basis towards the concentration.
The Senior Thesis will be completed in the 500-level course. All 500-level courses except
ECON-560
will have a corresponding 400-level elective as a co-requisite or prerequisite. Most economics concentrators will need to take both the 500-level course and the corresponding 400-level co-requisite in the same semester in their senior year.
Concentrators must complete the five core courses by the end of the junior year so that they may apply these analytical tools in their 400 level and 500 level courses. Additionally,
ECON-266
,
ECON-275
and
ECON-285
must be taken at Hamilton. For purposes of fulfilling the requirements for the concentration, the Department does not classify any transferred courses at the 400 level or above. See the departmental website for additional information on procedures for transferring credit for economic courses taken off-campus. Additionally, Independent Study ECON-499 is not classified as a 400 level elective. Exemption from these requirements is granted only in unusual cases.
ECON-166
is not open to students who have taken
MATH-152
or MATH-252 or MATH-253 or
MATH-352
. Students intending to fulfill a major requirement by taking
ECON-166
and who have completed one of these courses prior to taking
ECON-166
must take one additional economics course and one additional course outside the Department, selected in consultation with the department associate chair. ECON-220, ECON-230,
ECON-231
and
ECON-235
do not count toward the concentration.
Students planning graduate work in economics should consult a member of the department for specific advice. They should take selections from 400-level courses,
ECON-560
and obtain as strong a background in mathematics as possible. The sequence in calculus and linear algebra is required by virtually all good Ph.D. programs in economics; additional work in mathematics, such as courses in differential equations and real analysis, is strongly recommended. Students who plan to study for an M.B.A. should complete at least one semester of calculus and should consult âInformation for Prospective M.B.A. Students,â a document available at the Career Center Web site, for additional recommendations.
Departmental honors will be awarded to concentrators who demonstrate superior performance in economics, as evaluated by members of the department. For the class of 2026, 2027 and 2028 to be eligible for honors, a student must complete
ECON-560
, have a grade point average of at least 3.3 for all courses that satisfy the concentration and write an outstanding Senior Thesis. Starting with the class of 2029, to receive concentration honors, a student must complete an additional 400-level course and have an economics concentration grade point average of at least 3.7.
A minor in economics consists of four core courses and one additional economics course, with the exception of ECON-220, ECON-230,
ECON-231
or
ECON-235
, which do not count toward the minor. The four core courses are
ECON-100
,
ECON-166
,
ECON-275
,
ECON-285
.
ECON-275
and
ECON-285
must be taken at Hamilton. If the studentâs concentration is in public policy, the 100-level Economics courses cannot count in both the studentâs concentration and the minor. These courses will be used to satisfy concentration requirements, and they will be replaced by alternative courses in the minor requirements. These alternative courses will be chosen by the associate chair of the Economics Department in consultation with the director of the Public Policy Program. Economics minors may not take any full-credit course offered by the Economics Department at the 200-level or higher on a CR/NC basis. Economics minors can apply, at most, one 100-level course taken on a CR/NC basis towards the minor.
Seniors may not preregister for
ECON-100
but may add this course at the beginning of each semester, space permitting.
