Department/Program Student Learning Outcomes
Concentrators in Middle East and Islamicate Worlds Studies will be able to:
Communicate effectively in oral and written Arabic.
Develop an ability to interpret arguments about the history, politics and literary cultures of the Islamicate world.
Conduct research and demonstrate an understanding of the Islamicate world in the senior project.
Concentration/Minor Description and Requirements
Both a concentration and a minor in Middle East and Islamicate Worlds Studies are offered.
A concentration in Middle East and Islamicate Worlds Studies consists of nine courses. Concentrators must take 4 semesters of Arabic. Heritage speakers should contact the program director to discuss course placement. Arabic 115, 116 and Hebrew 107 and 108 do not count toward the concentration. Students interested in continuing Hebrew beyond the first year should consult with the program director about opportunities at area colleges.
Students must take at least one course in each of these major areas: literature; politics and history; religion and culture.
No more than two courses at the 100-level count toward the concentration. One course must be Writing Intensive.
Students must take 4 or 5 courses at the 200-level.
Students must take at least 2 courses at the 300-level. One of these courses could be Arabic 315 or 316.
The program strongly encourages students to study Arabic or other Middle Eastern languages off-campus, but does not require it.
The senior project will most often take the form of a major research or literary analysis paper. Students should consult with the program director during their junior year to identify an appropriate advisor. The project will be conducted either through an advanced-level course or an independent study.
To earn honors, the minimum GPA in the concentration is 3.6.
An interdisciplinary minor in Middle East and Islamicate Worlds Studies consists of five courses from the list below, including two semesters of Arabic or Hebrew. Students must take at least one course from each of three divisions: literature; social sciences; and religion and culture. One course must be taken at the introductory (100) level, and one at the advanced (300 or 400) level.
