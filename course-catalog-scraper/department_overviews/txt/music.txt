Department/Program Goals
The goal of the Music Department is to enable a broad range of students to explore a wide variety of musical experiences and practices. Supported by their development of musicianship and technical skills, concentrators will acquire a more sophisticated understanding of music in historical and cultural contexts, theory and composition, and performance, while pursuing one of these areas in greater depth.
Department/Program Student Learning Outcomes
Students Will Learn to:
Demonstrate active listening skills from among a wide variety of musical experiences and practices
Make links between various musical styles and their historical and cultural contexts
Demonstrate proficiency in various theories of music
Display skills in making music through performance, composition, recording, or production
