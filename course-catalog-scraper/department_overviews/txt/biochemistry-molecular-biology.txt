Department/Program Goals
The goal of the Biochemistry/Molecular Biology Program is to encourage students to explore biochemical concepts through extensive research opportunities and close collaboration between students and instructors.
Department/Program Student Learning Outcomes
Students Will Learn to:
Evaluate the scientific literature and other forms of professional communications in biochemistry and molecular biology
Solve problems at the interfaces of chemistry and biology using scientific reasoning
Communicate fundamental concepts of biochemistry and molecular biology to both expert and layperson in writing and oral presentations
Concentration/Minor Description and Requirements
The departments of Biology and Chemistry offer an interdisciplinary concentration in biochemistry/molecular biology (BMB). Prospective concentrators should elect both chemistry and biology in their first year. The concentration consists of 10 credits (and
MATH-113
and
MATH-116
, or equivalent, as prerequisites for certain courses), including four courses in BMB, two courses in biology, three courses in chemistry, and one credit of elective course(s) from a list of selected courses provided below. BMB courses must include
BICHM-270
,
BICHM-346
,
BICHM-550
and either
BICHM-321
or
BICHM-322
. Biology courses must include
BIO-100
and
BIO-211
. Chemistry courses must include
CHEM-120
,
CHEM-190
, and
CHEM-255
.
MATH-113
and
MATH-116
, or equivalent, are prerequisites for BICHM-320,
BICHM-321
and
BICHM-322
. The elective course must be chosen from
BIO-200
,
BIO-202
,
BIO-205
,

.
BICHM-346
satisfies the SSIH requirement for BMB concentrators.
BICHM-550
satisfies the Senior Thesis requirement. A complete description of the Senior Program is available from the departments. Honors in BMB will be based on excellence in coursework and on both Senior Thesis
BICHM-550
and
BICHM-551
.
