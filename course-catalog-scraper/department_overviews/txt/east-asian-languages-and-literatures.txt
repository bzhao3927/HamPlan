Concentration/Minor Description and Requirements
The East Asian Languages and Literatures Department consists of the Chinese program and the Japanese program. The department offers courses in Chinese and Japanese languages, film and media studies, literature, linguistics, and cultures. The department has concentrations and minors in both Chinese and Japanese.
Language courses focus on language acquisition and introduction to the cultures and civilizations of the target countries and regions. Both the Chinese and Japanese programs also offer culture, literature, film, media, linguistics, and pedagogy courses taught in English and the target languages. These courses are a vital part of the department’s concentrations and minors, and the courses offered in English also attract students who have not studied the languages but are interested in the cultures and society of East Asia.

, a concentration in Chinese consists of nine courses numbered 130 or higher, including at least one 400-level course (in the target language and culture course) in each semester of the senior year, and the required senior project (
