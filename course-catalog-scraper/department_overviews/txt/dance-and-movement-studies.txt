Department/Program Goals
The goal of the Dance and Movement Studies Department is to help students find and develop their own voices and identities through classes, workshops, projects, and productions that consider dance from creative, technical, historical, and scientific contexts.
Department/Program Student Learning Outcomes
Students will learn to:
Learn the fundamentals of movement through coursework in technique
Develop a vocabulary enabling them to analyze, discuss, and write about a wide range of dance and movement practices
Apply these concepts and principles in performance and the creation of original work including in solo and group performance, choreography, and improvisation
Develop an understanding of dance and movement in a broader cultural context
Concentration/Minor Description and Requirements
A concentration in dance consists of

,
DANCE-203
,

Beginning with the class of 2026, at least two different styles of dance/movement (ballet, contemporary, and martial arts) must be represented in the four semesters of technique.
The Senior Program in dance may be fulfilled through satisfactory completion of one of the following options: a Senior Thesis (
DANCE-550

No student who has completed the requirements and maintained at least a 3.0 (85) average in dance courses will be prohibited from selecting the performance/choreography option as his/her senior project. The department highly recommends that students qualifying for and electing
