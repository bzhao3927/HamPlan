Department/Program Goals

Students Will Learn to:
Construct meaning using visual information
Demonstrate a knowledge of the basic tools and techniques of new and traditional media
Analyze their studio processes by diagramming the stages in creative thinking
Use critique to formulate and build personal direction
Generate a public exhibition

Senior Project Exhibition
All senior concentrators are required to register for

ART-502
Senior Project Exhibition. Under certain circumstances and after consultation with Art department faculty, students may complete an additional 300-level course in studio art instead of continuing on to
ART-502
. In either case all students are required to have a public exhibition during their final semester.
A minor in art consists of
ART-104
or
ART-160
, one art history course and three additional studio art courses (which are not repeatable and are not all in the same media area). An independent study may not count toward a minor in art. Interested students should meet with the chair.
Concentrators in the Art Department will fulfill the Social, Structural, and Institutional Hierarchies (SSIH) requirement through participation in the departmentâs annual Visiting Artist Series and through subsequent discussion forums mediated by members of the art faculty in the contexts of their classes. Students must participate in a discussion of SSIH issues in the visiting artist series in at least two classes before engaging with these issues through the Visiting Artist Series as part of the senior program.
Honors in art will be awarded on the basis of a cumulative average of 3.7 or above in coursework toward the concentration, with a minimum grade of A- in
ART-501
and
