Department/Program Goals
The goal of the Public Policy Program is to prepare students to examine, shape, and participate in civic life in all its dimensions.
Department/Program Student Learning Outcomes
Students Will Learn to:
Understand the ethical dimensions of policy decisions and the justice implications of policy research
Communicate clearly and persuasively about public policy issues in their own research
Engage with stakeholders and policy makers as interns and researchers
Establish a foundation for professional work in policy science and policy making
Concentration/Minor Description and Requirements
The Public Policy Program is administered by the Government Department in cooperation with the Departments of Economics and Philosophy. A concentration in public policy consists of
PPOL-251
,
PPOL-382
and the Senior Project;
GOVT-116
and
GOVT-230
;
ECON-100
(prerequisite for
PPOL-251
) and
ECON-166
(prerequisite for
PPOL-382
);
Two courses in ethics (approved by the program director); and
One course on a specific public policy issue (approved by the program director).
Students are strongly encouraged to take
ECON-100
and
GOVT-116
in their first year, and to take
GOVT-230
and
PPOL-251
in their sophomore year. No student may declare a concentration in public policy without either completing or being enrolled in
PPOL-251
.
Concentrators must complete the following courses by the end of the junior year:
PPOL-251
;
PPOL-382
;
ECON-100
and
ECON-166
;
GOVT-116
and
GOVT-230
; and one of the required courses in ethics.
Concentrators fulfill the college’s Social, Structural, and Institutional Hierarchies (SSIH) requirement by completing
PPOL-251
and the Senior Project. To qualify for honors in public policy, a student must have an average grade of 90 (3.7) in courses taken in the concentration and perform with distinction in the Senior Project.
After declaring the concentration, students may not take any course on a credit/no credit basis if the course will be used to fulfill concentration or minor requirements.
Credit from academic work taken off-campus may be substituted for one of the ethics courses or for the course on a specific public policy issue required for the concentration, with the approval of the program director. Students interested in pursuing graduate study in public policy or public administration are encouraged to take additional courses in economics, in substantive areas of governance and politics, and in mathematics and statistics.
Public policy students will find the programs at the
Levitt Public Affairs Center
particularly helpful.  The Center provides speakers, leadership courses, summer research opportunities, and other activities that will augment and enrich the coursework in the concentration.
A minor in public policy consists of
PPOL-251
,
ECON-100
,
ECON-166
,
GOVT-230
, and one ethics course. If the student’s concentration is in economics, government or philosophy, these courses cannot count in both the student’s concentration and the minor. Instead, courses that are required for both the concentration and the minor will be used to satisfy concentration requirements, and they will be replaced by alternative courses in the minor requirements. These alternative courses will be chosen by the program director in consultation with the chair of the student’s concentration department.
