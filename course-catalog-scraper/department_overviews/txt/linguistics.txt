Department/Program Goals
The Linguistics Program exposes students to the study of the structure and use of language, and urges students to find the ways in which structure and use are interrelated. Students can explore language structure and use with faculty in the program through experimental and ethnographic methods.
Concentration/Minor Description and Requirements
Linguistics is the scientific study of language. Students will learn to examine language and languages in terms of structure (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics) and social use (pragmatics, language acquisition, discourse analysis, sociolinguistics, cultural interpretation).
The Minor in Linguistics is administered by Masaaki Kamiya (EALL), Chaise LaDousa (Anthropology), and Spencer Chen (Anthropology).
The minor in linguistics consists of five courses: an introductory course, one focusing on language structure, one focusing on language in society and two electives. These courses are to be selected from the linguistics courses currently available at Hamilton listed below.
