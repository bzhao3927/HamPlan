Department/Program Goals
The goal of the Data Science Program is to provide comprehensive training in this growing interdisciplinary field. Through courses in statistics, computing, and applied domains (e.g. government, environmental science, sociology), students explore the societal impact of data science and such ethical concerns as privacy rights and data validity.
Department/Program Student Learning Outcomes
Students will learn to:
Gain proficiency in the data life cycle: creation, curation, documentation, analysis, and communication.
Apply data science tools to real world problems and produce well documented and reproducible analyses.
Understand the social and ethical impact of the tools used in data science.
Concentration/Minor Description and Requirements
A Concentration in Data Science consists of 12 courses:
4 Required courses from Mathematics and Statistics Department:
MATH-116
,
MATH-216
,
MATH-254
and
MATH-351
.
Note 1:  An introductory applied statistics course such as
MATH-152
,
ECON-166
,
GOVT-230
,
ENVST-206
or PSYCH/
NEURO-201
is a prerequisite for
MATH-254
.
4 Required courses from Computer Science Department:
CPSCI-101
,
CPSCI-102
,
CPSCI-230
and
CPSCI-330
.
A Senior Program consisting of a Senior Seminar in Mathematics and Statistics or the Senior Seminar in Computer Science.
And one elective from each of the following
three
categories:
Foundational depth:
This is satisfied by an elective in either the Mathematics and Statistics Department or the Computer Science Department at the 300-level or above.
Suggested courses:
MATH-352
– Statistical Theory and Computation
MATH-356
– Statistical Methods in Machine Learning
MATH-509 – Senior Seminar in Applied Probability
CPSCI-350 – Database Theory and Practice
CPSCI-375
– Artificial Intelligence
CPSCI-380
– Theory of Computation
Ethics and social impact:
This elective should feature an examination of ethical and social concerns that can arise in the collection of data and application of algorithms. Pre-approved courses are:
ENVST-290
: Nature and Technology
PHIL-222
: Race, Gender and Culture
SOC-286
: Sociology of Science
GOVT-412
: The Politics of AI: Algorithms, "Big Data," and "Humans in the Loop"
ANTHR-259
: Digital Technology and Social Transformations
Domain of application:
This elective should demonstrate how the collection, visualization and interpretation of data have been integrated to advance knowledge within a specific domain. Pre-approved courses are:
BIO-212
: Introduction to Bioinformatics
BIO-214
: Health Care Systems
ECON-266
: Introduction to Econometrics
DARTS-203: Performance, Ritual and Technology
ENVST-222
: Environmental Spatial Analysis
ENVST-325
: Environmental Data Science
Students may petition the program committee to accept a course other than those on the pre-approved list to satisfy the ethics and social impact requirement and/or the domain of application requirement by providing a written rationale indicating how the course meets the goal of the elective category.
SSIH Requirement
SSIH requirement can be fulfilled by taking Math 254 (with a data analysis project focused on SSIH issues) which is the natural choice for many students in this program or by taking SSIH courses offered by other departments that are pre-approved by the Math department which are listed below:
MATH-498
,
ECON-166
, HIST-226 or, for those interested in pursuing a career in education,
EDUC-204
,
EDUC-206
,
EDUC-339
or EDUC-415.
Credit/No Credit Policy
Only Math 116 or Math 216 can be taken on a CR/NC basis and can be applied towards the concentration.
Honors Policy
Students may earn honors by completing courses that satisfy the concentration with an average of 3.6 or higher, by taking a fourth full-credit elective that is at the 300 level or higher, and by making a public presentation to the department on a Data Science topic (outside of class work) during their senior year.
