The field is interdisciplinary, encompassing the study of languages, literature, history, philosophy, material culture, art, and reception. The Department of Classics offers courses in Ancient Greek language (catalog label GREEK), Latin language (LATIN), and Classical Studies (CLASC). No knowledge of Ancient Greek or Latin is required for the courses labeled CLASC.\nA concentration in Classics requires a minimum of ten full-credit courses, including courses in CLASC and at least one of the two languages (GREEK or LATIN). Specifically, the concentration requires:\nAt least one of the following:\nCLASC-115\n,\nCLASC-120\n, or\nCLASC-240\nThree semesters of GREEK and/or LATIN, with at least one language course at the 300-level\nTwo additional 300-level courses in GREEK, LATIN, and/or CLASC\nThe senior seminar,\nCLASC-550\nThree additional courses at any level from GREEK, LATIN, and/or CLASC. Petitions to consider classes from outside the department should be submitted to the Chair. To ensure a successful petition, students must select courses that contain a significant component related to the history, culture, or influences and receptions of classical antiquity.\nTo satisfy the Social, Structural, and Institutional Hierarchies requirement (SSIH), concentrators must complete two courses with the SSIH designation. One of these courses will be the required\nCLASC-550\nSenior Seminar. The second course will likely be from the department (e.g.,\nCLASC-120\n,\nCLASC-205\n,\nCLASC-208\n,\nCLASC-280\n,\nCLASC-325\n, or\nCLASC-335\n). Petitions to consider an SSIH course from outside the department should be submitted to the Chair.\nThe concentration is designed with flexibility, to allow students to pursue one or more of the three areas (GREEK, LATIN, CLASC) to the highest level. Students intending to apply to graduate programs in Classics (language and literature, history, or archaeology) should be advised that most require at least 2-3 years of study in both Latin and Ancient Greek. There are some bridge programs and masters programs designed to help students strengthen their language skills before applying to PhD programs, but funding for these is competitive.\nJunior and Senior concentrators in Classics may NOT elect the credit/no credit option for Classics, Greek or Latin courses. Courses taken in the department as credit/no credit BEFORE the declaration of concentration may count toward the concentration requirements ONLY with the permission of the department Chair.\nStudents who have earned an A- (3.67) average or higher in the concentration may receive honors by earning a grade of A- or higher in the Senior Seminar. A description of the program may be obtained from any member of the classics faculty.\nConcentrators and other students trained in Latin or Greek are encouraged to spend one or two semesters of their junior year studying  in Greece, Italy, or at another suitable location. Hamilton is a member of the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome (the Centro), which runs a study abroad program for undergraduates in both Fall and Spring, and of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, which runs a study abroad program for undergraduates in the summer only. Interested students should note that admission to the Intercollegiate Center and the American School is competitive and that preparation in Latin or Greek, and sometimes both, is an important factor in determining admission. Many students have also attended other programs in Rome and Athens, including College Year in Athens, where students can enroll for the Fall, Spring, and/or Summer terms.\nA minor in Classics consists of five courses in the department, including coursework in CLASC and at least one of the two languages (GREEK or LATIN). Specifically, the minor requires:\nAt least one of the following:\nCLASC-115\n,\nCLASC-120\n, or\nCLASC-240\nOne semester of GREEK or LATIN\nOne 300-level course in either GREEK, LATIN, or CLASC\nTwo additional courses at any level from GREEK, LATIN, and/or CLASC\nHamilton’s distinguished tradition in classics ensures that funds are available from numerous awards earmarked for classics students, especially for students who continue with Greek or Latin, or who choose to do graduate work in Greek.",

The department offers courses in Chinese and Japanese languages, film and media studies, literature, linguistics, and cultures. The department has concentrations and minors in both Chinese and Japanese.\nLanguage courses focus on language acquisition and introduction to the cultures and civilizations of the target countries and regions. Both the Chinese and Japanese programs also offer culture, literature, film, media, linguistics, and pedagogy courses taught in English and the target languages. These courses are a vital part of the department’s concentrations and minors, and the courses offered in English also attract students who have not studied the languages but are interested in the cultures and society of East Asia.\nChinese Concentration\nBeginning with the Class of 2028\n, a concentration in Chinese consists of nine courses numbered 130 or higher, including at least one 400-level course (in the target language and culture course) in each semester of the senior year, and the required senior project (\nCHNSE-550\n).\nA minor in Chinese consists of five courses numbered 130 or higher, including at least one 400-level course.\nAfter being approved by the EALL department chair, students may use courses offered by other departments or programs that focus on Chinese-speaking societies or broader East Asian contexts to satisfy the concentration or minor requirements. Students who concentrate in Chinese may select the credit/no credit option for only one course used to fulfill their concentration requirements. Students in the minor may not use any courses graded CR/NC for minor requirements.\nFor Concentrators prior to the Class of 2028:\nA concentration in Chinese consists of nine courses numbered 140 or higher, including at least one 400-level course (in the target language and culture course) in each semester of the senior year, and the required senior project (\nCHNSE-550\n).

The economics courses must include five core courses and four elective courses. The five core courses are\nECON-100\n,\nECON-166\n,\nECON-266\n,\nECON-275\n, and\nECON-285\n.\nMATH-113\nor its equivalent is one of the prerequisites for\nECON-275\n. At least one elective must be at the 400-level and at least one must be at the 500-level and taken as a senior. Economics concentrators may not take any full-credit course offered by the Economics Department at the 200-level or higher on a CR/NC basis. Economics concentrators can apply, at most, one 100-level course taken on a CR/NC basis towards the concentration.\nThe Senior Thesis will be completed in the 500-level course. All 500-level courses except\nECON-560\nwill have a corresponding 400-level elective as a co-requisite or prerequisite. Most economics concentrators will need to take both the 500-level course and the corresponding 400-level co-requisite in the same semester in their senior year.\nConcentrators must complete the five core courses by the end of the junior year so that they may apply these analytical tools in their 400 level and 500 level courses. Additionally,\nECON-266\n,\nECON-275\nand\nECON-285\nmust be taken at Hamilton. For purposes of fulfilling the requirements for the concentration, the Department does not classify any transferred courses at the 400 level or above. See the departmental website for additional information on procedures for transferring credit for economic courses taken off-campus. Additionally, Independent Study ECON-499 is not classified as a 400 level elective. Exemption from these requirements is granted only in unusual cases.\nECON-166\nis not open to students who have taken\nMATH-152\nor MATH-252 or MATH-253 or\nMATH-352\n. Students intending to fulfill a major requirement by taking\nECON-166\nand who have completed one of these courses prior to taking\nECON-166\nmust take one additional economics course and one additional course outside the Department, selected in consultation with the department associate chair. ECON-220, ECON-230,\nECON-231\nand\nECON-235\ndo not count toward the concentration.\nStudents planning graduate work in economics should consult a member of the department for specific advice. They should take selections from 400-level courses,\nECON-560\nand obtain as strong a background in mathematics as possible. The sequence in calculus and linear algebra is required by virtually all good Ph.D. programs in economics; additional work in mathematics, such as courses in differential equations and real analysis, is strongly recommended. Students who plan to study for an M.B.A. should complete at least one semester of calculus and should consult âInformation for Prospective M.B.A. Students,â a document available at the Career Center Web site, for additional recommendations.\nDepartmental honors will be awarded to concentrators who demonstrate superior performance in economics, as evaluated by members of the department. For the class of 2026, 2027 and 2028 to be eligible for honors, a student must complete\nECON-560\n, have a grade point average of at least 3.3 for all courses that satisfy the concentration and write an outstanding Senior Thesis. Starting with the class of 2029, to receive concentration honors, a student must complete an additional 400-level course and have an economics concentration grade point average of at least 3.7.\nA minor in economics consists of four core courses and one additional economics course, with the exception of ECON-220, ECON-230,\nECON-231\nor\nECON-235\n, which do not count toward the minor. The four core courses are\nECON-100\n,\nECON-166\n,\nECON-275\n,\nECON-285\n.\nECON-275\nand\nECON-285\nmust be taken at Hamilton. If the studentâs concentration is in public policy, the 100-level Economics courses cannot count in both the studentâs concentration and the minor. These courses will be used to satisfy concentration requirements, and they will be replaced by alternative courses in the minor requirements. These alternative courses will be chosen by the associate chair of the Economics Department in consultation with the director of the Public Policy Program. Economics minors may not take any full-credit course offered by the Economics Department at the 200-level or higher on a CR/NC basis. Economics minors can apply, at most, one 100-level course taken on a CR/NC basis towards the minor.\nSeniors may not preregister for\nECON-100\nbut may add this course at the beginning of each semester, space permitting.",

A complete description of the Senior Program is available in Christian Johnson 202.\nHonors\nStudents with a cumulative average of A- for the nine courses in the Department are eligible for honors. A senior completing an independent research project in\nFRNCH-550\nis exempted from writing the senior paper in the spring seminar, but is expected to complete all the other assignments.\nMinor\nA minor in French consists of five courses numbered 140 or higher, including at least one course focusing on literature (\nFRNCH-211\n,\nFRNCH-212\nor other) and one course at the 300 level or higher.\nCourses in English\nThe Department offers a limited number of courses in English on French and Francophone topics that may be of interest to students from any number of departments. Please see\nFRNCH-160\nand\nFRNCH-240\nbelow at the end of the list.\nHamilton in France\nOpen to students in good standing at the Fr 140/200 level, Hamilton in France is fully integrated with Hamilton’s academic program. It can enhance every student’s studies, regardless of his or her major.\nAfter a preliminary orientation and in consultation with the director, students choose to enroll in courses among those designed for Hamilton students and those offered at various Paris universities and post-secondary institutions in all academic fields.\nDepending on their linguistic ability and academic preparation, HiF students may choose from among a wide variety of courses in the Arts and Art History, Cinema, Economics, French language and literature, History, Music, Philosophy, Political Science, Natural Sciences and Math, Sociology, and Theatre, at the University of Paris 3, Paris 6, Paris 7 or at institutes such as the Institut d’Etudes Politiques, the Institut Catholique and the Ecole du Louvre. With permission of their department, majors in the Arts may take courses in their field including Studio Art, Photography, and Theater. For more complete information refer to\nHamilton in France\nwebsite.\nAll courses taken through Hamilton in France count toward Hamilton’s graduation requirements. In addition, students with concentrations other than French and Francophone Studies may, with approval from the appropriate department, apply HiF courses to their concentration (e.g. Political Science, History).\nWhile the French and Francophone Studies department believes that far greater linguistic and cultural benefits are gained from an academic year in France than from a semester, Hamilton in France program welcomes students for either a full academic year or for one semester. Concentrators and other engaged language students are encouraged to participate in the nine-month program.",

Of these seven courses, at least two must be in international relations or comparative politics, at least two must be in American politics or political theory, at least two must be at the 300 level (one of which must be writing-intensive and taught by a Government Department instructor), at least one of which must fulfill the Social, Structural, and Institutional Hierarchies Requirement (see below), and one must be the Senior Project (\nGOVT-550\n). A minor in government consists of five courses, with at least two of these at the 200 level or above.\nAfter declaring the concentration, students may not take any course on a credit/no credit basis if the course will be used to fulfill concentration or minor requirements.\nHonors in government or world politics requires a GPA of 3.8 in the major by the end of the sixth semester, maintaining that average at graduation, and the successful completion of\nGOVT-549\nand\nGOVT-551\n.\nWORLD POLITICS\nThe world politics major involves the study of politics on a global scale, including both international relations and politics within nations. In order to understand the complex interplay of international and national politics, all world politics majors study the philosophical and moral bases of various political systems; the history of the modern international system; the political economy of global power and wealth; and the key issues for U.S. foreign policy. To achieve this understanding, all world politics majors are required to take a total of 11 courses, including the following core courses:\nGOVT-112\n,\nGOVT-114\n,\nGOVT-117\n(one of which must be writing-intensive);\nGOVT-240\nor\nGOVT-290\n;\nGOVT-226\nor\nGOVT-291\n; at least one of which must fulfill the Social, Structural, and Institutional Hierarchies Requirement (see below), and\nGOVT-550\n. Students complete the major by focusing either on a particular region of the world (Africa, Asia, Latin America, Middle East, Russia and Eastern Europe, Western Europe) or a thematic topic (poverty and inequality in world politics, democratization, international law and organization, international security, politics of the global economy, nationalism and identity in global politics). In consultation with their advisor, students will select five related courses in their area or theme from a variety of departments. One of these must be a writing-intensive course at the 300 level and taught by a Government Department instructor. For students focusing on a region of the world, one of the five courses must be in an appropriate language at the fourth-semester level or above. Students may also design their own thematic track with the advice and consent of their advisor. The advisor will approve each studentâs course list after the major is declared.\nAfter declaring the concentration, students may not take any course on a credit/no credit basis if the course will be used to fulfill concentration or minor requirements.\nPublic Policy\nSee the\npublic policy\nsection in this catalogue.\nSOCIAL, STRUCTURAL, AND INSTITUTIONAL HIERARCHIES REQUIREMENT:\nPolitical science provides insights into the formation and persistence of structural and institutional hierarchies as well as to the political and social movements that have challenged them. Students in Government and World Politics must take at least one course where these issues are specifically addressed by the entire course or substantial portions of it. Among the courses that we believe currently meet the requirement are listed below. Other courses, with the permission of the instructor, the studentâs advisor, and the department chair, may also be used to satisfy the requirement.\nCurrently, the following courses fulfill the SSIH requirement:\nGOVT 201: Introduction to Feminist Thought (cross-listed from WMGST)\nGOVT 224: Presidential Nomination Campaign Fieldwork\nGOVT 226: Comparative Political Economy\nGOVT 229: The American Founding\nGOVT 234: The Politics of Equality\nGOVT 244: Nationalism and the Politics of Identity\nGOVT 249: American Political Thought\nGOVT 270: Democratic Theory\nGOVT 273: Law and Justice Lab\nGOVT 291: International Political Economy\nGOVT 337: Civil Wars\nGOVT 340: Race and American Democracy\nGOVT 358: International Law and Organization\nGOVT 359: American Policing\nGOVT 360: Politics and Theory of Place and Space\nGOVT 368: Violence, Justice, and the State in Latin America\nGOVT 389: Capitalism, Democracy, and the Workplace\nGOVT 394: Social Movements and Political Protest\nPPOL 251: Introduction to Public Policy\nPPOL 382: Topics in Public Policy\nAdditional courses may be counted as fulfilling the SSIH requirement, subject to the Departmentâs approval.",

Cecilia Hwangpo\nJack Martínez Arias\nEdna Rodríguez-Plate (away 2025-26, Academic Year in Spain)\nJoana Sabadell-Nieto\nDepartment/Program Goals\nThe goal of the Hispanic Studies Department is to help students employ the methods of literary and cultural analysis to develop an informed understanding of Spain, Latin America, and Hispanic U.S., and to reach oral and written proficiency in the Spanish language.\nDepartment/Program Student Learning Outcomes\nStudents will learn to:\ndemonstrate oral proficiency in Spanish.\ndemonstrate written proficiency in Spanish.\nutilize their curricular studies of the Spanish language and Hispanic cultures through experiential learning.\ndemonstrate disciplinary practice by producing literary/film criticism that argues an original thesis.\nConcentration/Minor Description and Requirements\nThe Hispanic Studies Department offers a diverse curriculum that includes Spanish language study for both non-heritage and heritage speakers, and Latin American, Spanish and U.S. Latinx literature and culture studies. In our Centro Universitario de Estudios Hispánicos in Madrid we also offer courses in social sciences, art, cinema and dance. The Hispanic studies concentration consists of nine courses numbered 150 or higher, including\nHSPST-200\n, one elective in the 200 series, three electives at the 300 level or above — including at least one in both Latin American and Peninsular fields (one of these must focus on literature before 1800) — and one course at the 400 level. Concentrators must also fulfill a cultural requirement that can be met through study abroad or a cultural studies course. Any course offered by another department that focuses specifically on Latin America, Spain or U.S. Latinx may satisfy the 200-level requirement but will not count as one of the nine concentration courses. Concentrators may include one course in translation as one of the required courses for the major. Five of the nine courses required for the major must be taken at Hamilton. It is strongly advised that all concentrators study abroad in a Spanish-speaking country. Beginning with the class of 2020, students concentrating in Hispanic Studies must satisfy the Social, Structural, and Institutional Hierarchies requirement by completing HSPST 200W: Exploring Hispanic Texts.\nIn order to complete the Senior Program, senior concentrators in Hispanic Studies (non-honors candidates) will: 1) enroll in a 300-level or 400-level course in the fall semester, and a 400-level course in the spring semester (in the spring seniors will complete a research project in a 400-level course; spring semester advanced courses are doubly designated as 300/400 [i.e. 310/410], in order to distinguish seniors who are writing the senior research project from other students. Thus if a senior plans to take more than one advanced course in the spring, they should take only one course at the 400 level); 2) participate in an assessment of oral proficiency in an interview conducted by outside examiners in the fall semester. Concentrators may not normally fulfill the requirement for the major through the election of a 200-level course during their senior year.\nSenior honors candidates will: 1) enroll in a 400-level course in Hispanic Studies in the fall semester; 2) enroll in\nHSPST-550\nand complete a senior thesis in the spring semester; 3) participate in an assessment of oral proficiency in an interview conducted by outside examiners in the fall semester. In order to attain honors in Spanish, students must have an average of 3.7 or better in the nine courses required for the major and must complete\nHSPST-550\n(senior thesis) with an A- or better. Senior honors candidates who are studying in Spain (with HCAYS) during the fall of their senior year are exempt from the fall 400-level course requirement.\nThe Hispanic studies minor consists of five courses numbered 150 or higher, including HSPST 200W, and at least one course at the 300 level. One of these courses may be taken in translation. Three of the five courses for the minor must be taken at Hamilton.\nNote: 200-level courses are not open to students who have previously taken 300-level courses in Hispanic Studies or in a Spanish-language study abroad program. Students with a concentration or minor in Hispanic Studies cannot take HSPST courses on a credit/no credit basis.\nAcademic Year in Spain\nThe Academic Year in Spain was established in 1974 to offer the highest interdisciplinary academic standards in foreign study programs (distinguished professors, small classes and a rigorous Spanish-only pledge), along with careful attention to the intellectual, cultural and social needs of each student. Directors-in-residence are drawn from the Department of Hispanic Studies at Hamilton College. The program is administered at Hamilton by a general director and by the programs abroad committee, and representatives of Swarthmore and Williams Colleges serve as directing advisors to the program and are instrumental in deciding important curricular and administrative matters and in long range planning. Also affiliated with the program are Amherst College and Princeton University. A board of advisors, drawn from such institutions as Bates, Brown, Bryn Mawr, Bucknell, Colby, Grinnell, Harvard, Reed, Scripps, Smith, Stanford, Wellesley and Yale, further helps in matters of recruitment and student preparation. All courses are taught entirely in Spanish and include language and linguistic studies, culture studies and study in the social sciences. Courses offered include advanced language, the art of translation, the history of Spanish art, cinema, analysis of poetic texts, Cervantes, contemporary theater, 19th- and 20th-century Spanish and Latin American narrative, contemporary Spanish and Latin American history, the economy of Spain, anthropology, sociology, contemporary Spanish politics, flamenco and studio art. The program also offers internships sculpted to each student’s area of interest and preparation. Students are taught by faculty members from leading universities in Madrid. Language and civilization classes form part of the fall orientation program in Galicia, while a similar orientation for spring students takes place in Andalucía. Frequent group excursions throughout Spain complement the rich academic and social opportunities offered to students in Madrid. The program is open to sophomores, juniors and first-semester seniors. Although the program is designed for a full-year, application may be made for either the fall or spring sessions. To be eligible, students must normally have completed at least one 200-level Hispanic studies course and have a strong academic average.",

    "text": "Overview\nFaculty\nStephanie Bahr\nPatrick Caoile\nNaomi Guttman, associate chair\nTina Hall\nTara Holman\nT Kira MÄhealani Madden\nVincent Odamtten\nOnno Oerlemans (on leave fall 2025)\nJane Springer\nPavitra Sundar\nSuzanne Taylor\nKatherine Terrell\nMargaret Thickstun (on leave fall 2025)\nAnne Valente (on leave fall 2025)\nBenjamin Widiss, chair\nSteve Yao\nSpecial Appointment\nChristian Goodwillie\nPhil Memmer\nSteve Schillinger\nDepartment/Program Goals\nThe goal of the Literature and Creative Writing Department is to help students develop a sophisticated understanding of the role literature plays in the human experience through refining their skills as interpreters of literary texts and as writers, either of literary analysis or of their own creative works.\nDepartment/Program Student Learning Outcomes\nLiterature Students Will Learn to:\nWrite clear and well supported arguments about literary and/or other cultural texts\nDemonstrate knowledge of diverse literary traditions across historical periods, geographic regions, and/or social contexts\nAnalyze literary works compellingly in contexts informed by literary criticism and/or broader regions, and/or social contexts\nCreative Writing Students Will Learn to:\nWrite with an awareness of the literary traditions within which they are working\nWrite with attentiveness to form and genre\nWrite a sustained creative project that demonstrates originality and attention to language\nConcentration/Minor Description and Requirements\nThe Department of Literature and Creative Writing offers two concentrations, one in the study of literature, and one in the art of creative writing.\nEach concentration consists of 10 courses: four exploratory courses chosen from among the categories listed below; one course in creative practice; four focus courses specific to the concentration; and one senior seminar specific to the concentration. Both concentrations incorporate a language requirement and a social, structural, and institutional hierarchies (SSIH) requirement. Courses taken for the concentration should reflect historical and geographical breadth. The department also welcomes comparatist and interdisciplinary work.\nExploratory Courses: The following categories name key approaches in literary and cultural studies. Students must take at least one course in each of these categories, for a total of four exploratory courses.\nHistory (organized around literary or other histories)\nTheory (highlighting theory and theoretical approaches)\nGenre (addressing concepts of genre or genres)\nIntermedia (juxtaposing different artistic media)\nThese categories reflect, but do not exhaust, various ways of conceiving the relationships between texts and thus approaches to literary study. Many departmental courses could appear under several of these categories; in practice, each course’s professor has specified one or two categories as predominant in its design and execution. Some courses are not tagged, for they model other approaches to studying cultural texts (e.g. the study of a single theme, author, or literary genealogy or influence); such courses may still count toward the concentration, in the focus section. A course with two of the above category designations may satisfy either category, but not both, in any individual student’s program of study.\nCreative Practice: To hone students’ sense of the constraints, challenges, and possibilities inherent in composing original (written) work, the department requires that all concentrators take Introductory Poetry and Fiction Workshop (\nCRWR-215\n) or its equivalent (Literature concentrators, see below).\nFocus Courses: Honoring the spirit of Hamilton College’s open curriculum, the department invites literature concentrators to design their own individually focused area of study in consultation with their advisers. Looking beyond course titles and tags, concentrators forge unexpected connections between courses and identify thematic, methodological, or other threads that define a coherent focus. The focus section for creative writers emphasizes craft and genre-specific coursework at the intermediate level.\nSocial, Structural, and Institutional Hierarchies: Scrutinizing social, structural, and institutional hierarchies (SSIH) via textual and historical analysis is a longstanding practice in literary studies. Many of our courses, but particularly those labelled SSIH, raise questions about social stratification stemming from constructs like gender, race, class, sexuality, and disability. They probe how texts both reflect and challenge such structural inequalities. They ask how canon formation, literacy rates, publishing and distribution practices, and legal and popular debates around censorship, for instance, have shaped the reach and readership of particular texts. They also study literary and cultural movements that interrogate contemporary and historical norms that ascribe value to certain texts and authors, and not to others. SSIH courses with a second tag (History, Theory etc.) may fulfill this requirement, in addition to counting in the exploratory or focus section. These courses must be completed within the department.\nLanguage Study: Students of literature are, among other things, students of language. The department requires that concentrators take at least two semesters of language study, focusing on the history of English, the classical languages of Greek and Latin, or modern languages. Here are four paths to complete this requirement:\nCompletion of two courses at the college level in a single language other than the student’s native language (courses taught in a foreign-language department in which class readings and discussions are in English do not count); OR\nCompletion of Introduction to Old English (\nLIT-221\n) and The Making of English (\nLIT-293\n) or equivalent courses taken elsewhere and approved for transfer credit; OR\nCompletion of either\nLIT-221\nor\nLIT-293\n(or equivalent) and a course focused on linguistics or a classical language (such as Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, Classical Chinese, etc); OR\nCompletion of two courses in linguistics.\n------\nLITERATURE\nHere is a checklist outlining the requirements for a concentration in literature:\n1. Four exploratory courses, one each from the following categories: History, Theory, Genre, and Intermedia.\n2. One creative practice course, such as\nCRWR-215\nor a course in another creative practice chosen in consultation with, and approved by, the concentration advisor. Normally, students may not elect more than one workshop in a given semester.\n3. Four focus courses that constitute an individually focused area of study, developed in consultation with, and approved by, the concentration advisor. A provisional plan must be submitted by the end of the sophomore year and revised, as necessary.\n4. Two SSIH courses. These courses may be in either the exploratory or focus section (or both), and they must be taken within the department.\n5. Two additional language courses. These courses will not count toward the ten-course concentration requirement.\n6. Only one 100-level course may count toward the concentration, in either the exploratory or focus section. A 100-level course is not required for the concentration.\n7. At least three courses must be at the 300-level or above. These courses may be in either the exploratory or focus section (or both), and may include the senior seminar.\n8. Senior Program:\na. A 300-level course tagged Methods must be taken before taking the senior seminar or embarking on the honors thesis. This course must be taken within the department.\nb. A 400-level seminar taken during the senior year within the department. Students may elect to take 400-level seminars in their junior year. While such seminars may count toward the concentration, they will not fulfill the senior program requirement.\n9. Credit/No Credit: Concentrators may count one 100- or 200-level literature course taken credit/no credit toward the concentration. Creative writing workshops taken credit/no credit cannot be counted toward the concentration. (This does not include courses or workshops taken in Spring 2020.)\n10. Students may apply up to two courses from study-abroad programs. These courses may not substitute for those stipulated above (Methods and SSHI courses, 400-level seminar) as departmentally taught.\nHonors in Literature: Candidates for honors in literature must attain a GPA of at least 3.7 in the courses counting for the concentration and complete an independent honors project that earns a grade of at least A-. The senior seminar remains a separate requirement. Students with honors-level GPAs as of spring junior year will be invited to participate as seniors in a year-long advanced research methods course in support of the independent project. Honors candidates must submit project proposals to the department for approval in October; students whose projects are accepted will be assigned individual thesis advisors. Normally, only honors students will write independent projects. The department encourages students thinking of pursuing honors or graduate studies in literature to take Literary Theory and Literary Study (\nLIT-315\n).\nLiterature Minor: A minor in literature consists of five courses. At least one of these courses must be at the 300-level or above. Only one 100-level course may count toward the minor. All courses must be taken within the department. No courses taken C/NC may be counted toward the minor. Students concentrating in creative writing may not minor in literature.\n------\nCREATIVE WRITING\nHere is a checklist outlining the requirements for a concentration in creative writing:\n1. Four exploratory courses, one each from the following categories: History, Theory, Genre, and Intermedia.\n2. One creative practice course: Introductory Poetry and Fiction Workshop (\nCRWR-215\n).\n3. Four focus courses: Intermediate Poetry Workshop (\nCRWR-304\n), Intermediate Fiction Workshop (\nCRWR-305\n), Poetry and Poetics (\nLIT-204\n), and a creative writing or literature course of the student’s choice. Workshops must be taken at Hamilton. Normally, students may not elect more than one workshop in a given semester. A provisional plan must be submitted by the end of the sophomore year and revised, as necessary.\n4. One SSIH course. This course may be in either the exploratory or focus section, and it must be taken within the department.\n5. Two additional language courses. These courses will not count toward the ten-course concentration requirement.\n6. Only one 100-level course may count toward the concentration, in either the exploratory or focus section. A 100-level course is not required for the concentration.\n7. At least three courses must be at the 300-level or above. These courses may be in either the exploratory or focus section (or both), and may include the senior seminar.\n8. Senior Program: Concentrators must take the Senior Seminar in Creative Writing (\nCRWR-419\n).\n9. Credit/No Credit: Concentrators may count one 100- or 200-level literature course taken credit/no credit toward the concentration. Creative writing workshops taken credit/no credit cannot be counted toward the concentration. (This does not include courses or workshops taken in Spring 2020.)\n10. Students may apply up to two courses from study-abroad programs. These courses may not substitute for those stipulated above (Workshops, SSIH, Senior Seminar in Creative Writing) as departmentally taught.\nHonors in Creative Writing: Students who by the end of the junior year have completed the three workshops (\nCRWR-215\n,\nCRWR-304\n, and\nCRWR-305\n) with distinction (3.7 or above) and have performed with distinction in their concentration courses overall (3.7 or above) will be invited to propose an honors project and will design, under the supervision of a creative writing professor, a year-long project to be started in the fall of their senior year. The department will recommend for honors students who receive an A- or better on work submitted for honors and who maintain a cumulative average of 3.7 or better in courses taken for the concentration overall and in the workshops calculated separately.\nCreative Writing Minor: A minor in creative writing consists of five courses, all taken within the department: three literature courses;\nCRWR-215\n; and either\nCRWR-304\nor\nCRWR-305\n. Only one 100-level course may count toward the minor. No courses taken C/NC may be counted toward the minor. Students concentrating in literature may not minor in creative writing.",

Concentrators fulfill the Senior Program requirement by taking a Senior Seminar. It must be taken in the fall of the studentâs senior year, and all lower-numbered required courses, with at most one exception, should be completed prior to that time.\nPHYS-320\nor\nPHYS-325\n, but not both, may be counted toward the concentration as an elective at the 200-level. Among the courses counted for the concentration must be one that is applied in focus; these courses are\nMATH-152\n,\nMATH-231\n,\nMATH-234\n,\nMATH-235\n,\nMATH-254\n,\nMATH-260\n,\nMATH-351\n,\nMATH-361\n,\nMATH-510\n,\nMATH-525\n,\nPHYS-320\nor\nPHYS-325\n. Concentrators are encouraged to take an introductory course in computer programming, such as\nCPSCI-101\n. Mathematical thinking and programming mutually reinforce each other, and many careers involving quantitative skills also require some experience with programming.\nAt most one course taken on a CR/NC basis may be applied towards the concentration; this course may not be one in the Mathematics and Statistics Department that is numbered 224 or higher.\nBeginning with the class of 2020, students concentrating in mathematics must satisfy the Social, Structural, and Institutional Hierarchies requirement by completing one of\nMATH-254\n,\nMATH-260\n,\nMATH-498\n,\nECON-166\n, HIST-226 or, for those interested in pursuing a career in education,\nEDUC-204\n,\nEDUC-206\n,\nEDUC-339\nor EDUC-415. Students who have not completed one of these courses may petition the department to accept a course in another department as fulfilling the SSIH requirement by providing a written rationale explaining how the proposed course will help them gain an understanding of social, structural, and institutional hierarchies that is relevant to mathematics and their post-graduation plans.\nStudents may earn departmental honors by taking for a grade a fourth full-credit elective that is at the 300 level or higher, by obtaining a concentration average of 3.6 or higher, and by making an approved and high-quality public presentation to the department on a mathematical or statistical topic during their junior or senior year. The presentation topic must be an extension beyond previous course work.\nA minor in mathematics consists of\nMATH-116\n,\nMATH-216\n,\nMATH-224\nand two electives. At most one course taken on a CR/NC basis may be applied towards the minor; this course may not be one in the Mathematics and Statistics Department that is numbered 224 or higher.\nA minor in statistics consists of five courses:\nMATH-116\n,\nMATH-216\n,\nMATH-152\n,\nMATH-254\nand\nMATH-351\n. Students may substitute\nECON-166\n,\nGOVT-230\nor\nPSYCH-201\n/\nNEURO-201\nfor 152. Students may use Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or A-level courses to count for only one of the five courses. Students with two or more such courses, or who want to count\nECON-166\n,\nGOVT-230\n, or\nPSYCH-201\n/\nNEURO-201\ntoward a concentration or another minor, may complete the minor in statistics by taking\nCPSCI-101\n,\nENVST-222\n,\nENVST-325\n,\nMATH-352\n,\nMATH-356\n, or\nGOVT-412\n, up to a total of five courses, of which at least four must be in the Mathematics and Statistics Department. Students in this situation may petition the department to accept a course other than those listed here by providing a written rationale explaining the relevance of the proposed course to statistics. A student with a concentration in mathematics or data science may not minor in statistics. At most one course taken on a CR/NC basis may be applied towards the minor; this course may not be one in the Mathematics and Statistics Department that is numbered 224 or higher.",

Todd Franklin\nMarianne Janack (on leave Fall 2025)\nRussell Marcus (On leave 2025-26)\nPhyllis Pearson\nAlexandra Plakias, chair\nMichael Veldman\nDepartment/Program Goals\nThe goal of the Philosophy Department is to work with students to develop the skills of critical analysis, powerful speaking, and clear writing, skills alumni find of singular practical use in a wide variety of careers, and indispensable to their work as responsible citizens. We emphasize the value of philosophical examination for understanding broad issues that concern us all.\nDepartment/Program Student Learning Outcomes\nStudents Will Learn to:\nExplain a range of philosophical views, historical and contemporary\nIdentify philosophical problems in philosophy, other academic disciplines, or outside the academy\nFormulate their own views about philosophical problems in conversation with other philosophical works\nDefend those views cogently in writing and in speech\nConcentration/Minor Description and Requirements\nThe concentration in philosophy consists of nine courses:\nPHIL-201\n,\nPHIL-203\n, and\nPHIL-550\n; and\nOne logic course: either\nPHIL-100\n,\nPHIL-200\n, or\nPHIL-240\n; and\nThree additional courses at the 400 level, no more than one of which may be transferred from outside of Hamilton College; and\nTwo electives in philosophy.\nConcentrators must also satisfy the Social, Structural, and Institutional Hierarchies (SSIH) requirement in a course so designated. Concentrators may satisfy the SSIH requirement with a course they are counting toward the concentration requirements 1-4 above. Courses from outside of Hamilton may fulfill the SSIH requirement at the discretion of the chair.\nNo more than one of the nine courses counted toward the concentration may be at the 100 level. Any course may be taken credit/no credit for the concentration or minor except 550.\nProspective concentrators are encouraged to complete\nPHIL-201\n,\nPHIL-203\nand the logic requirement (either\nPHIL-100\n,\nPHIL-200\n, or\nPHIL-240\n) by the end of their sophomore year, but this is not required.\nSenior concentrators complete the Senior Seminar (\nPHIL-550\n) in the fall of the senior year. Each student in\nPHIL-550\nwill complete a senior project.\nCandidates for honors must have a 3.7 in all courses in Philosophy, and must also have an A in the senior project, and at least an A- in 550.\nA minor in Philosophy consists in any five Hamilton Philosophy courses, with no more than one at the 100 level and at least one at the 400 level. No more than one course taken outside of Hamilton may substitute for one of the five.\nFirst-year students may enroll in\nPHIL-200\n,\nPHIL-203\n, or\nPHIL-240\nwith no prerequisites.

Given the various trajectories of Hamilton students, this education prepares students for physics graduate school; supports students in their pursuit of different quantitative interests including engineering, chemical physics, and careers where quantitative analysis is employed; fulfills the one-year introductory physics requirements for students pursuing health professions, chemistry, and graduate work in other sciences; and includes courses accessible to students across the campus with a wide variety of interests and mathematical backgrounds.\nDepartment/Program Student Learning Outcomes\nStudents Will Learn to:\nExhibit broad understanding in foundational physics\nUse foundational physics to analyze a diverse set of complex problems\nDemonstrate skills for experimental physics\nDemonstrate skills in technical communication\nConcentration/Minor Description and Requirements\nA concentration in physics normally consists of 11 courses:\nPHYS-190\n,\nPHYS-195\n,\nPHYS-290\n,\nPHYS-295\n,\nPHYS-215\nor\nPHYS-348\n,\nPHYS-390\n,\nPHYS-550\n, and four other electives chosen in consultation with an advisor who is a member of the physics faculty. At least one of the electives will be selected from physics courses at the 300-level or above, not including\nPHYS-348\nand\nPHYS-390\n.  One of the electives may be taken credit/no credit. Students who wish to prepare for graduate school in physics or engineering should choose electives from physics courses at the 300-level and above. Students with other interests may, in consultation with their advisor, select up to two electives from other science departments. Such courses should support interdisciplinary interests or career goals. Normally\nPHYS-390\nis taken in the spring semester of the junior year in preparation for the research project undertaken in\nPHYS-550\n. To be eligible for honors in physics students must have a grade point average of at least 3.5 in the courses that satisfy the concentration requirements and must complete outstanding work in the senior project.\nIn the first year, prospective concentrators should normally take\nPHYS-190\nand\nPHYS-195\n, and mathematics. In the first semester, the appropriate mathematics course may be Calculus I (\nMATH-113\n), which is a co-requisite for\nPHYS-190\n. However if the Mathematics Department grants advanced placement, the student may wish to take Calculus II (\nMATH-116\n), Multivariable Calculus (\nMATH-216\n), or Linear Algebra (\nMATH-224\n). Students with significant experience with physics, including advanced placement courses, should consult with a member of the department before registering for a physics class.\nStudents who wish to major in physics but who have taken either\nPHYS-100\n-\nPHYS-205\nor\nPHYS-200\n-\nPHYS-205\n, or who wish to begin the major should consult with the department chair.\nPHYS-290\nand\nPHYS-295\nare normally taken in the second year. Additionally, during the spring of the second year, we recommend taking one course from Electronics and/or General Relativity. Other options should be discussed with a member of the physics faculty.\nWe believe that our students need to be aware how historical contributions of underrepresented groups in science illuminate inequalities of opportunity to contribute to science and technology, that a diversity of perspectives are crucial to science when dealing with complex problems, that the impact of science is both local and global, and that science policy decisions are made in the real world in which biases might be hidden. Concentrators may satisfy the SSIH requirement by completing\nPHYS-215\nor\nPHYS-348\n.\nA minor in physics consists of five courses:\nPHYS-190\n,\nPHYS-195\n,\nPHYS-290\nor\nPHYS-295\n, and two other physics courses. One of the other physics courses may be taken credit/no credit. Students can complete the minor with\nPHYS-100\n-\nPHYS-205\nor\nPHYS-200\n-\nPHYS-205\n, plus three other physics courses, of which one must be at the 200 level or above. Students may use Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or A-level courses to meet only one of the five required courses for the minor. A minor in astronomy consists of five courses: a 2-course introductory sequence (\nPHYS-190\n-\nPHYS-195\n,\nPHYS-100\n-\nPHYS-205\n, or\nPHYS-200\n-\nPHYS-205\n),\nPHYS-290\n,\nPHYS-160\nand an upper level elective chosen in consultation with the chair. A student who majors in physics may not minor in astronomy.\nStudents interested in the 3-2, 2-1-1-1, or 4-2 engineering programs affiliating Hamilton with engineering schools should normally take\nPHYS-190\n,\nPHYS-195\n, and calculus (or linear algebra if mathematics placement so warrants) in their first year. Students in the 3-2 program are expected to complete the first three years of the major including at least 8 courses in physics. There are many possible options in engineering programs, and because of their complexity, interested students should consult the engineering advisor, Professor Gordon Jones. This is also the case for those who have taken 100-105 or 200-205 and have then become interested in engineering.\nStudents seeking to transfer credit in physics for part of the introductory sequence (100-205 or 200-205) at another institution must successfully complete one course of introductory sequence at Hamilton. Successful completion requires a minimum grade of B.\nJuniors or seniors without prior courses in the department may enroll in\nPHYS-100\n,\nPHYS-120\n,\nPHYS-135\n,\nPHYS-136\n,\nPHYS-160\n,\nPHYS-175\n,\nPHYS-200\nand\nPHYS-245\n.",

The credit may not be applied toward the Psychology concentration or minor; concentrators must still take a total of ten courses.\nTo fulfill the Social, Structural, and Institutional Hierarchies requirement in Psychology, concentrators must take either ONE course from the following list:\nPSYCH-321\n(Psychology of Gender and Leadership)\nPSYCH-324\n(Law and Human Behavior)\nPSYCH-379\n(Lifespan Development) Formerly PSYCH-350\nPSYCH-359\n(Stereotyping and Prejudice)\nPSYCH-367\n(Psychological Bias in the Justice System)\nor TWO courses from the following list:\nPSYCH-316\n(Developmental Psychology of Self-Control)\nPSYCH-337 (Psychology of Friendship)\nPSYCH-353\n(Adult Psychopathology)\nPSYCH-355\n(Neurobiology of Addiction)\nPSYCH-356\n(Social Psychology)\nPSYCH-373\n(Health Psychology)\nCourses taken off-campus may fulfill the SSIH requirement; students should consult with the chair to determine whether the course(s) will count toward the first or second list, above.\nStudents should plan to complete their lab requirement and\nPSYCH-380\nbefore completing their Senior Project. The Senior Project involves an extensive research and theoretical inquiry culminating in a written thesis and an oral presentation. Starting with the class of 2025, the Senior Project will be completed in one semester with the option to complete the project in either the fall or spring semester.\nStudents may not take any course at the 200 level or above on a credit/no credit basis if the course will be used to fulfill concentration or minor requirements.\nDepartmental honors in psychology recognize the distinguished achievement of students who excel in their coursework in the concentration.\nA minor in Psychology consists of five courses: a 100-level introductory course;\nPSYCH-201\n; one laboratory course numbered between 300 and 327 (except\nPSYCH-320\n); and two other courses (one of which may be\nPSYCH-204\nor\nPSYCH-205\n).\nThe departments of Biology and Psychology offer an interdisciplinary concentration in neuroscience.
