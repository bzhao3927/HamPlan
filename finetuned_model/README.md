    \    EDUCATIONAL GOALS Participation in Orchestra emphasizes the College’s Educational\
    \ Goals of   Analytic Discernment – the ability to analyze sound in terms of intonation,\
    \ balance, blend, rhythm, and other musical variables, and use that information\
    \ in practice and rehearsal  Aesthetic Discernment – developing an ‘ear’ for the\
    \ distinct styles and affects in of each of the works we are performing; becoming\
    \ familiar with the sound world of each composer  Disciplinary Practice – understanding\
    \ and applying the focused, sustained, methodical effort over time necessary to\
    \ develop a high level of skill in playing your instrument, of playing in an ensemble\
    \   Communication and Expression – the ability to convey affect and character\
    \ through musical means.  GRADES   are based on (1) Attendance, (2) Consistency\
    \ of music preparation, (3) Development of ensemble skills   (watching, listening,\
    \ counting, rhythm, intonation), (4) General conscientiousness and professionalism.\
    \  ATTENDANCE  The rehearsal schedule is sent by email at the beginning of each\
    \ week; orchestra members are on call for regular rehearsal times until that week’s\
    \ schedule is announced.   Rehearsals will start promptly at the announced time.\
    \ Allow enough time to get everything you need and be ready to play.  Academic\
    \ and extracurricular activities outside normal class hours (lectures, exams,\
    \ class presentations, review sessions) are not automatically excused. Your prior\
    \ commitment is to the regularly scheduled rehearsal time and any additional times\
    \ listed in the syllabus.   How to handle this? Let your professor know of the\
    \ conflict with another class, and request that other arrangements be made for\
    \ you to take the exam.  Notify me as early as possible if you are unable to come\
    \ to rehearsal, including if you are not feeling well – at least ½ hour before\
    \ start of rehearsal. Special circumstances considered at the director’s discretion.\
    \ \nAttendance is one of the main factors for your grade: - After one rehearsal\
    \ missed, each additional rehearsal missed is a reduction of 1/3 letter grade.\
    \ - Lateness or leaving early may count as a partial absence. - A single missed\
    \ dress rehearsal will result in a deduction of a full letter grade. - A missed\
    \ concert will result in a deduction of two letter grades.  REHEARSAL ETIQUETTE\
    \  Everyone in the ensemble is called on to help create a respectful and productive\
    \ working atmosphere in rehearsal. Common sense and general thoughtfulness apply.\
    \ In particular: - Be considerate of the rehearsal – no talking or extraneous\
    \ playing, particularly during tuning notes. - No food, drinks, or cell phones\
    \ are allowed in rehearsal. - Pick up whatever you bring with you onstage. - Cello\
    \ and bass players: make sure to use a rock stop, rubber tip guard, or strap to\
    \ secure your end pin. Bare end pins cause significant damage to the stage floor.\
    \ - If you have a long rest or a tacet movement, stay nearby. No walking out,\
    \ except to deal with a problem with your instrument, or if it’s a true emergency.\
    \  GENERAL HEALTH AND HYGIENE PROTOCOLS    It is important to protect everyone’s\
    \ health by following best practices: - If you have respiratory symptoms, let\
    \ the director know promptly, and don’t come to rehearsal.  - You can resume normal\
    \ activities once your symptoms are improving and you’ve been fever-free (without\
    \ fever-reducing meds) for at least 24 hours.  - For five days after resuming\
    \ normal activities, take extra precautions, including wearing a well-fitting\
    \ mask and maintaining distance from others, etc.  - If symptoms or fever return,\
    \ start back at square one: stay home and away from others until you’ve been improving\
    \ and fever-free for at least 24 hours. - Brass players – use paper towels or\
    \ a cloth towel for condensation at all times when playing. Do not empty spit\
    \ valves on the floor.  ORCHESTRA MUSIC  Music is to be marked in pencil only,\
    \ and to be kept in good condition in the orchestra folders provided. Have a sharpened\
    \ pencil with eraser at all rehearsals.  Orchestra music is to be kept in the\
    \ HCO music folders, and folders are kept in the orchestra music cabinet. Make\
    \ sure your folder is returned to the cabinet after every rehearsal.  Take good\
    \ care of your orchestra music – don’t subject it to excess wear and tear, water\
    \ damage, or fold or mark it with ink. Any damaged or lost parts must be paid\
    \ for at replacement cost.  LESSONS AND PRACTICE  All Orchestra members are encouraged\
    \ to take private lessons. Lesson scholarships are available on request to Orchestra\
    \ members who need financial assistance.  Orchestra members are expected to learn\
    \ your orchestra music through consistent practice outside of rehearsal over the\
    \ semester, and to keep track of which passages you need to work on. This is checked\
    \ at the music checkups before performances.  CONCERT ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENT \
    \  HCO members are expected to attend three concerts per semester, normally in\
    \ Wellin Hall and sponsored by the Performing Arts at Hamilton. Be sure to have\
    \ your attendance recorded by student workers inside Wellin Hall. Students taking\
    \ private lessons will not be required to attend additional concerts above the\
    \ requirement for lessons. Some recommended performances this semester:   Friday,\
    \ September 5  7:30p Faculty Concert  Friday, September 12 7:30p Art Under Pressure:\
    \ Music of Shostakovich & Weinberg    Friday, September 19 7:30p HC Performing\

  - "ECONOMICS 346: MONETARY POLICY  \nFall 20 25 \n \nProfessor : Ann Owen  \naowen@hamilton.edu\
    \ , KJ-210, x4419 \n \nOffice Hours:   Tuesdays 12:30 to 2, Thursdays, 2 to 3:30,\
    \ and by appointment \n \nCourse Overview  \n The overriding objective of this\
    \ course is to increase students’ understanding of the goals, strategies, and\
    \ tactics of monetary policy.  The course will focus on monetary policy in the\
    \ U.S. and explore the interaction of the central bank with financial markets,\
    \ the tools and the transmission mechanism s of \nmonetary policy,  the structure\
    \ of the Federal Reserve System, the international financial system, and \ndecision\
    \ -making under uncertainty as it applies to the policy process.  By the end of\
    \ this course, students \nwill understand how monetary policy strategy is designed\
    \ and implemented and how the implementation of these strategies affects financial\
    \ markets and the macroeconomy.  \n This course is a speaking intensive class,\
    \ and an additional goal of the class is to improve your ability to \nexpress\
    \ economic ideas and arguments effectively in oral presentations and discussion.\
    \   Assignments are \ndesigned to help you improve both your speaking and listening\
    \ skills. \n \nAssignments & Grading  \n \nThe grade for the course will be determined\
    \ as follows:  \n      \nClass Participation     15% \nEconomic Briefing    15%\
    \ \nBriefing Audience Assignment    5% \nArticle Presentation     15% \nFOMC Press\
    \ Conference Watch Party   10% \nTeal Book      20% \nQuizzes       20% \n \n\
    Class Participation  \nThe c ontribution your participation makes to the class\
    \ will influence your final grade.  In determining \nyour participation grade,\
    \ I will consider the quality of your in- class comments, you r participation\
    \ in \nonline discussions , as well as the quality of the feed back you give to\
    \ your fellow students during and after \ntheir oral presentations.   \n \nIn\
    \ evaluating your participation in class, general guidelines I use are as follows:\
    \ \nC:  Prepared for class and attentive in class.  Infrequent or low quality\
    \ comments B:  P repared for class,  attentive and makes good comments on a regular\
    \ basis  \nA:  P repared  for class, attentive, makes high -quality comments \
    \ on a regular basis  \n High -quality comments relate readings and topics from\
    \ previous classes to the current topic or are \nparticularly insightful about\
    \ the topic at hand.  Missing more than two classes over the course of the semester\
    \ will make it difficult for any student to ear n an A for participation. \n \n\
    Economic Briefing \nWe will be closely following economic developments to facilitate\
    \ the discussion of current issues in monetary policy.  To help keep the class\
    \ up to date on current economic events, groups of two to three students will\
    \ take turns briefing the entire class on financial market developments, recent\
    \ releases of economic data, and recent developments in international markets.\
    \  The presentation should both report on \nrecent events as well as interpret\
    \ them for policy makers.  Students should be prepared to answer questions from\
    \ me and from the class and should make a copy of their slides available to the\
    \ other students in the class via the shared Google drive for the class.  We will\
    \ schedule these presentations during th e first week of classes.  My expectations\
    \ for the quality of these presentations will increase as \nthe semester progresses.\
    \  \n Article Presentation  \nOver the course of the semester, each student will\
    \ present one article that relays a key concept for the class.   This will be\
    \ a 15 minute solo presentation.  Scheduling will occur at the beginning of the\
    \ semester. \n FOMC Press Conference Watch Party  \nThe FOMC will hold three press\
    \ conferences over the course of the semester during our class period, typically\
    \ starting  at 2:30 pm.  We will watch these together in class and then discuss.\
    \  Your participation \nin these discussions and the notes you take during the\
    \ press conference will be used to determine your grade for this assignment. \
    \     \n Teal Book  \nThe Federal Open Mark et Com mittee will meet on December\
    \ 9 and 10, 2025.  In preparation for this \nmeeting, members of the FOMC will\
    \ read the “ Teal Book,” a document (with a teal  cover) of \napproximately eight\
    \ to ten pages compiled by the Federal Reserve staff that analyzes the current\
    \ state of \nthe economy and discusses policy alternatives and their likely impact.\
    \  Y our assignment is to write a \nsimilar paper, making a recommendation for\
    \ the action to be taken at the December FOMC meeting.  The \nTeal B ook  is due\
    \ n o later than 2 pm  on Wednesday , December 1 0.  During the final exam period\
    \ for \nthis class, I will meet briefly with each of you to discuss your paper.\
    \ \n \nQuizzes  \nWe will have 4 short quizzes on the readings and topics discussed\
    \ in class .  In addition to being familiar \nwith content from class, t hese\
    \ quizzes will require you to know the main idea of each article assigned and\
    \ \nhow that idea relates to current issues in monetary policy or to the main\
    \ idea of other readings.   No make -\nup quizzes are given.  If you miss a quiz\
    \ for a ny reason, future quizzes will have a greater weight in the \ncalculation\
    \ of your final grade.  \nA Few Words About Keeping Up with Current Events \n\
    \ Keeping informed about current economic news will be a critical component of\
    \ your success in the class.  In addi tion to the Wall St. Journal , you will\
    \ also find the New York Times , The Economist , and many \nInternet sites to\
    \ be helpful in this endeavor.  Be careful to be a critical consumer of news,\
    \ including noting bias in any source and the extent to which reporting can be\
    \ corroborated with other sources. \n \nUse of Artificial Intelligence Tools \
    \ \nThe ways in which AI can be used on specific assignments are detailed on assignment\
    \ directions.  Any use of AI that is not explicitly  allowed for an assignment\
    \ will be considered a violation of the Honor \nCode.  \n \n \nPreliminary Outline\
    \ of Topics  \n Please note that this is a flexible syllabus-- topics in this\
    \ class will respond to current economic events and \ninterests of the class.\

  - 'Description: This course will explore intersections between conceptions of Islam
    and politics, religious and political community, national belonging and anti-colonial
    thought, minoritization and subalternity, among Muslims in Asia. Through a close
    reading of primary sources, films, and literature, we will critically examine
    the tensions between collective identity and individual aspirations, secularism
    and religion, ethics and politics to understand what it has meant to be a Muslim
    in the modern era. Finally, the course will pay particular attention to historical
    methods and think through alternative ways of researching and writing the histories

    rewrite the boundaries of genre, questioning, for example, the relationship between
    fiction and autobiography. This course explores the innovative ways that black
    writers have reimagined their places in the nation and responded to the efficacy
    of identity, of race, gender, and sexuality, as ways to understand the self and
    the collective. Texts will include Audre Lorde''s Zami, Jamaica Kincaid''s Lucy,
