- source_sentence: What is the procedure for cleaning glassware in the lab according
    to the syllabus?
  sentences:
  - 'Bring your laptop! 12/11 Final Paper PresentationFinal Paper Presentation: 5
    minutes pre-senting topic, outline and proposed evidence followed by questions
    and discussion. TBDSubmit Final Paper!'
  - 'step. Lab Clean Up: You are responsible for cleaning up your hood and glassware
    before you leave lab. Clean glassware by rinsing organic residue into the organic
    waste jar with a small amount of acetone, wash with soap and water, and then return
    it to your drawer. Do no leave glassware out on the bench, in a sink, drying rack,
    or hood. Lab Reports: You will have a lab report to submit in paper for all experiments
    except one, which will have an oral report. These are due at the start of your
    lab session according to the due dates listed in the lab schedule. All writing
    should be in past tense, using passive voice. There are three general formats
    for the reports this semester: 1. For some reports there will be specific questions
    to answer included in the lab handout. Your responses may be handwritten on the
    lab handout sheets or typed in a separate document. Write out all work for any
    calculations. Be sure to be concise and say only what is needed to answer the
    question. 2. For reports without specific questions at the end of the handout,
    you will write a brief (no more than two pages) discussion section to analyze
    your results. These reports should be. These should begin with a summary of your
    collected data, such as yield, and include any calculations. For the majority
    of this section you will interpret your results, writing a strong argument to
    support your conclusions. There are tips for writing strong arguments below. 3.
    For one experiment you will do an oral report (there is no pre-lab or lab notes
    for this experiment either). You will receive detailed instructions for the oral
    report in the experiment’s lab handout. You are required to have an appointment
    with the OCC before you give your presentation. For all labs, you will be working
    with spectral data to analyze the outcome of the experiment. You will be required
    to submit your labeled spectra for each experiment and there is a guide to labeling
    spectra properly on blackboard. Properly labeling spectra is crucial to the report
    and to your analysis so take care reviewing this. If you have any questions, please
    do not hesitate to ask for help! For many reports, you will also need to write
    a mechanism for the performed reaction. These can be handwritten in your reports
    but must be complete, including arrow pushing. Grading: Your pre-lab, lab notes,
    and report will receive one letter grade; each experiment will be weighed equally.
    Late reports will be penalized with a partial letter grade deduction per day (one
    letter grade per week). If a report becomes three weeks late, it will receive
    a zero. Failing to turn in two labs will result in failing the course. If you
    have a reason you may need an extension, you must contact me before the due date
    (ideally as early as possible) so we can arrange something. Please reach out if
    you need help or'

  - 'A simple dimensional analysis can catch a big mistake. Question numeric answers.
    (10) Use a reasonable number of significant digits in your answer, usually no
    more than 3. More digits do not make a result more accurate. Way too many sig
    figs will result in up to 10% reduction. (11) Write out final copy from your solution
    notes. If you make a mistake at the end or a problem, don’t erase what you did
    before or rewrite everything. Just cross out or mark what you found to be wrong
    and continue with a correct solution. (This shows the grader that you checked
    what you have completed.) (12) Present the answer in the form asked for. For example,
    if an electric field (which as you know is a vector quantity) is asked for, do
    not just give the magnitude. (13) Celebrate your final answers with a box. (14)
    Attend office hours! Attend office hours! Attend office hours! (15) Collaborate
    but write up your own solutions this includes any Mathematica code, spreadsheets,
    or similar computation. When you work with friends and your solution is founded
    on some of 4 their ideas, you must cite them. Citation may be informal. The format
    is not important. Most students acknowledge these discussions with a note next
    to the solution. (16) If you use other resources such as solutions you must cite
    these. If you use online material cite the url where these were obtained. (17)
    Write down clearly and unambiguously with whom you worked on the problem and any
    re- sources you consulted. (18) If you find where Townsend writes something like
    ‘My colleague said we need a wave equation. Well, I found one!’ let me know where
    and who said this for a bonus point on the homework. (19) Build a top notch, easy
    to access set of records for the course - notes, problem sets, and corrected solutions.

  - 'In addition to participating in regular in -class and small group activities,
    you will also be expected to prepare for four (1 per unit) full class discussions
    throughout the semester. For these four classes, we will spend the majority of
    class talking abou t ideas and examples you bring with you to class. Prior to
    the discussion, I will provide you will a prompt. The day of, I will check that
    you have notes (written, or on a phone, tablet, computer, etc) that indicate you
    have spent time outside of class pre paring for the discussion topic at hand and
    award points accordingly. Together, preparation and engagement make up 30% of
    your final grade . Excused Absences : You are expected to attend every class.
    You are allowed two absences for the semester, but starting with the third, all
    absences must be excused with proper documentation. You cannot be engaged and
    prepared as outlined above if you are not present in class , so after two absences,
    I will deduct 10 points from your engagement/preparation grade for each unexcused
    absence. Examples of acceptable excused absences include, but are not limited
    to, significant mental or physical health concerns (with a note from a healthcare
    professional; please do not send me pictures of illness or injury as “proof”),
    religious observances, Col lege-sponsored travel (for sports or other activities),
    family emergencies, and job/graduate school interviews. I understand that unexpected
    things happen and aren’t always easy to document, so please come talk to me if
    life circumstances are preventing yo u from coming to class or getting your work
    done. Assignments: For unit s 1-3, you will complete one creative - or research
    -based assignment based on a related topic per unit (3 assignments total). Guidelines
    for each assignment are posted on Blackboard . Assignments make up 30% of your
    final grade (10% for each assignment). Quizzes: In-class quizzes will take place
    a t the end of each unit (4 quizzes total). Quizzes may include listening identification,
    multiple choice, fill -in-the-blank, and short answer questions, and they cover
    content only from the corresponding unit (not cumulative). Contact me to make
    up quizzes for excused absences, ideally before the day of the quiz if possible.
    I do not offer make up quizzes for unexcused absences. Quizzes make up 20% of
    your final grade (5% for each quiz) . Final project: For your final project, you
    (or you and a partner) will choose a musical work that has not already been discussed
    in class that you think matches the theme of one of units 2 -4 well and reflect
    on the most important musical characteristics of and contextual information about
    the song (see Blackboard for more details) . I can help you come up with a topic
    if needed , but I encourage you to think outside the box and choose something
    that interests you! You can present this information in a ny mediu m of your choice

    exams for this course?
  sentences:
  - grade will remain a zero. 4 Exams You will take four exams in this course, plus
    a cumulative final (see section below about the final). Exams are designed to
    assess your deep understanding of the material, and generally include short answer
    questions, short essays, and calculations/interpretations. Previous students have
    appreciated having more than 50 minutes to complete exams, so exams are held in
    the evening on the dates listed in the syllabus. We have two rooms (SCCT G041
    and G042) so that you can spread out; students from both sections of Psych Stats
    will take their exams at the same time. TAs will be available to distribute and
    collect exams and answer questions. You may come anytime between 4-10pm; the exams
    should generally take you 1.5 – 3 hours. Leave yourself plenty of time; the TAs
    will not stay past 10pm. You will be permitted to bring a calculator (not your
    phone) to exams. You will be provided with formulas and any necessary statistical
    tables. The formula sheets for each exam are provided on Bb under “Exam stuff”
    so you can see ahead of time what formulas will be provided. Please inform me
    at the beginning of the semester if you have a conflict with any of the evening
    exams. Final Exam The final exam will be an open-book, open-notes practical exam
    using SPSS. You will be given data sets for two different hypothetical studies
    and will analyze and interpret the data to test different hypotheses. We’ll talk
    more about the final as it approaches, and we’ll do practice problems together
    in class. Seven practice problems are already posted to Bb if you’re curious and
    want to take a look. Extra Credit Opportunities You may earn a maximum of 3 extra
    credit points using any combination of the following methods; each submission
    is worth up to 0.2 points added to your final grade for the course. Extra credit
    may not be used to increase a final grade from an A to an A+ or from a failing
    to a passing grade. Participating in Research Studies You may earn extra credit
    by participating in research studies conducted by faculty and students in the
    Psychology Department. For every 30 min. of participation, you will be awarded
    0.2 extra-credit points toward your final grade. You may sign up for studies on
    SONA (http://hamilton.sona-systems.com). If you miss two sessions without 24-hour
    prior cancellation (there is no penalty to cancel), your SONA access will be revoked
    and you will be ineligible for extra credit via research participation for the
    rest of the semester. Sona closes at 4pm on the last day of classes; you are responsible
    for making sure your participation tally is accurate. If your tally is inaccurate
    or you are having difficulty accessing the web-based interface, please contact
    sona@hamilton.edu. Understanding Statistical Analyses in Journal Articles You
    may earn extra credit by reading an empirical journal article describing original
    psychological research and writing a summary that explains the statistical analyses
    used and why they

    is a serious offense in an academic community. At Hamilton such dishonesty will
    often result in removal from the course, assignment of an XF* for the course,
    or separation from the College community, or some combination of these. It is
    essential, therefore, that every student understands the standards of academic
    honesty and how to avoid dishonesty by proper acknowledgment of intellectual indebtedness.

    several ingredients for succeeding in this class. 1. Come to class prepared to
    discuss the material for that day’s lecture. Being prepared means: actively read
    the material by investigating the concepts on your own—practice implementing and
    running code, seek answers in other texts, on Wikipedia, StackExchange, and discuss
    with classmates. Concepts can then be strengthened and expanded in lecture. 2.
    F or every hour in class, you are expected to spend 2–4 hours outside of class
    on reading, working on assignments, and studying for exams. Be sure this time
    is productive—seek advice if you find yourself ‘spinning your wheels’ . 3. Invest

  - 'the first semester course, the bulk of the labs were designed to expose you to
    the basic techniques that are important to doing organic chemistry. Now that you
    are familiar with those techniques, the focus of most of the labs this semester
    is on solving an intellectual problem and the skills that are emphasized are in
    analyzing data and communicating your results and analysis. Once again, these
    are general skills that should translate to other areas of your life. Hopefully,
    the relationship between the specific course goals stated above and the College’s
    educational goals is pretty obvious. The emphasis on problem solving and the nature
    of the problems that you will face directly relate to Intellectual Curiosity and
    Flexibility, Analytical Discernment and Creativity. In both lecture problems and
    the labs, you will have opportunities to learn to think and experiment like a
    chemist, engaging in Disciplinary Practice. Written and oral lab reports will
    enhance your skills in Communication and Expression. Key Concepts In addition
    to the broader learning goals described above, you should be aware of how the
    concepts carry over from one course to another within the Chemistry curriculum.
    Key concepts that you learned in Organic I that are especially important in Organic
    II include: 1. Basics of structure: bonding, resonance, hybridization, and drawing
    orbitals 2. Higher order aspects of structure: conformation and stereochemistry
    3. Effects of structure on properties (especially resonance) and reactivity (functional
    group transformation) 4. Acid/base chemistry (Brønsted-Lowry and Lewis): determining
    relative strengths of acids/ bases and being able to predict which side of an
    equilibrium is favored 5. Basics of arrow pushing; at a higher level, the ability
    to use this logic to predict new reactions and mechanisms 6. Basics of synthesis:
    retrosynthesis, multistep synthesis, functional group compatibility or incompatibility
    with different reactions, combination of ideas to create a new reaction for a
    synthesis 7. Interpretation of spectral data (IR, MS, NMR) 8. Understanding of
    kinetics and thermodynamics in an organic context 9. Recall of key reactions (the
    Grignard reaction, oxidation/reduction of alcohols/carbonyls, alkene hydration,
    elimination reactions, epoxidation, conversion of alcohols to bromides, radical
    halogenation) Key concepts that are taught in Organic II are: 1. Understanding
    complex organic reaction mechanisms 2. More complex syntheses and synthetic planning
    3. Chemistry of carbonyl compounds (enols/enolates, nucleophilic additions, etc.)
    including carboxylic acid derivatives 4. Amine chemistry 5. Chemistry of conjugated
    systems: aromaticity and reactivity of aromatic rings (EAS, NAS); cycloadditions;
    conjugate additions 6. Ability to analyze multiple variables (substrate, reactants,
    solvent, temperature, etc.) to predict the outcome of a reaction Key concepts
    that are taught in Organic II that will be especially important in future courses
    (Chem 263 Quantitative Environmental Chemistry, Chem 265 Inorganic Chemistry and
    Materials, Chem 270 Biological Chemistry) include: 1. Structure and bonding in
    organic molecules (270) 2. Reactivity of functional groups (i.e. identify an acid/base,
    nucleophile/electrophile, carbonyl derivative) (270) 3. Basics of acid-base equilibria

    Exams that are missed cannot be made up, except under certain circumstances (documented
    medical emergencies). You may not reschedule an exam to accommodate personal or
    family travel needs. If an academic, athletic, or professional activity is scheduled
    on the day of an exam, I am willing to consider administering a make-up. But you
    must let me know as soon as possible, preferably in the first three weeks of class,
    and you must provide documentation of your participation in the activity. This
    includes conferences related to a club or activity. Please inform me in the first
    three weeks of class about anticipated absences for religious holidays. If you

    If you would like to be addressed using a name or gender different than the one
    indicated on the course registration list, please let me know. Exams will include
    material covered in readings and class discussion. Please inform me ahead of time
    if you would like to bring a guest to class. I encourage you to come to office
    hours to discuss your assignments and any other academic issue that you would
    like to talk about. If you have a letter from Disability Services Office about
    accommodations for a disability, please provide a copy of that document by email

    end of class. My notes will include basically everything I write on the board,
    and probably some extra details as well. In addition to the textbook, you would
    be wise to read my notes regularly. My primary goal in making my notes available
    to you is to give you the option to take fewer notes of your own. Research shows
    that a student who attempts to transcribe a lecture word- for-word will typically
    end up with a lower level of comprehension than a student who jots down only the
    main ideas and summarizes key concepts in his or her own words. The former student
    is focusing too much on copying, while the latter student is actively processing
    the material in real time. Since you will have my notes, you may prefer to not
    take your own notes. Or you may prefer to take some notes, with an eye toward
    synthesizing big-picture ideas as opposed to transcribing every detail. Or you
    may ultimately decide that you learn best by copying down every single word. Everyone
    learns differently, so just do whatever feels right to you. Exams There will be
    two midterm exams and a cumulative final exam, each with a 3-hour time limit.
    Midterm exams will be from 7 - 10 p.m. •Exam 1 will be Monday, October 6. •Exam
    2 will be Monday, November 17. •The Final Exam will be Tuesday, December 16 from
    7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. The date and time of the final exam is set by the registrar
    and cannot be rescheduled for individual students. Please make your winter travel
    plans accordingly. Homework There will be two types of homework assignments. The
    first are computational assignments , which will consist of relatively straightforward
    exercises to give you practice with the tech- niques we learn in class. The second
    type are writing assignments , where you will write proofs. Whereas the computational
    assignments will be graded by student graders, I will grade the writing assignments
    myself. Also, whereas you can use pencil and paper for the computations, your
    work on the writing assignments should be typed up using the math typesetting
    program LATEX, which I will teach you how to use. You will do the computational
    assignments individually. You will also do the first couple of writing assignments
    individually, but on writing assignments after that you will be divided into teams
    of two, and each team will turn in just one copy of their joint work. Assignments
    will usually be due on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays at 8:00 p.m. Your work
    on all assignments should be submitted through Gradescope. 2 Our student graders
    will be working hard to give you detailed feedback on your homework. To protect
    their time, I will not be asking them to grade homework turned in more than 24
    hours late. For this reason, I will not grant extensions on homework assignments,
